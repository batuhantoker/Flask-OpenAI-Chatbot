Critics say the burgeoning industry is creating millions of zombified addicts who are turning on and tuning into computer games, and dropping out of school and traditional group activities, becoming uncommunicative and even violent because of the electronic games they play. ""Game players don't have normal social relationships anymore,"" said Kim Hyun Soo, a 36-year-old psychiatrist who is chairman of the Net Addiction Treatment Center, one of many groups that have sprung up to cope with Internet game addiction.

Jim Whitehead <ejw@cse.ucsc.edu>,CD player UI for toddlers,"So, like many young children, my daughter Tatum (age 21 months) *really* likes music. She also likes to have control over her environment, and this means she wants to be the one putting CDs into the CD player, and getting the music playing. By watching Tatum, I've discovered that you can learn a lot about UI design from watching 21-month-olds use technology. There is definitely a market niche for a toddler-friendly CD/MP3 player. The CD player we have combines play and pause in a single button, but doesn't provide *instantaneous* feedback that the button was pushed, instead requiring you to wait until the music starts, 5-10 seconds. This is a UI disaster. Since Tatum doesn't get feedback right away, she presses the button again, thereby pausing the CD before it even plays. She'll only ever get music if she presses the button an odd number of times. This happens a surprising amount of the time, since she eventually hits the button again when the music doesn't play. For toddlers, pressing play must cause the music to start immediately, within half a second, for the toddler to get the causality and not press the button multiple times. As well, pressing the button multiple times shouldn't change the semantics, like an elevator button. No matter how many times you press, the elevator still comes to that floor. The play button needs to be the same. The back-hinged door mechanism feeding the CD into the player is also a UI disaster for Tatum. Since the door hinges on the back, Tatum has to angle CDs to put them in, and take them out. Putting CDs in isn't much of a problem, but taking them out is. Since Tatum grabs CDs by the back edge, that edge comes out first, hitting the lid. Tatum eventually forces and wiggles the CD out, a process that's hard on the CD and the player (but which hasn't yet resulted in the CD player being broken). Surprisingly, it hasn't been a problem getting the CD hole onto the spindle -- Tatum seems to understand this concept, and the CD load area geometry naturally guides the CD. Tatum's CD player also plays tapes and has FM radio. For a toddler, this is a mistake. Tatum doesn't understand the need to flick a switch to put the player into a specific mode. She understands putting a CD in, and pressing the play button. She sometimes understands the buttons for advancing a song, but uses them erratically. As well, the radio feature has both FM mono and FM stero, a distinction totally lost on Tatum. Tatum only understands the binary distinction of music/no music. What would the ideal toddler CD player be like? It would immediately start playing a CD after it was loaded. As soon as the CD load door was closed, it would give some audible feedback. It would have a single large play button. The other typical CD controls would be larger than normal, but at least half the size of the play button, and located far away from the play button, so there is no chance of them getting accidentally pressed on the way to play. The play button would be a bright color that is different from the color of the player, and different from the color of the other CD control keys. The device would only play CDs, no other functions. The CD load area would flip open at least 80 degrees. It should be small, approachable for a toddler. It should be possible to repeatedly drop the player from a height of 1-2' without affecting the player. - Jim",0

If I currently have an email server named, say, mail.comcast.net, with user name timmy, then I change my email reader to say that my server is 127.0.0.1, and that my user name on that server is mail.comcast.net:timmy.

"""R. A. Hettinga"" <rah@shipwright.com>",TGE: Thugs of South Boston and The Revenge of the Bandit Princess,"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA1 Thugs of South Boston and The Revenge of the Bandit Princess The Geodesic Economy Robert A. Hettinga Sunday, August 25, 2002 (BOSTON) When you think about it one way, the FBI/Winter Hill vs. Patriarcha/Angiulo Cosa Nostra fight was just another race war between thugs. Put crudely, and at its most racist, the FBI and the Winter Hill Gang were the (mostly) Irish thugs, and Patriarcha's ""family"" were, of course, the (mostly) Italian thugs. Think Scorsese's upcoming ""Gangs of New York"", only with counter-reformatory overtones. Hoover's South Boston ""social-club"" putsch, starting in the mid 1960's, was particularly audacious in hindsight. The U.S. Federal Government actually decided to underwrite a reversal of the prohibition-era capture of the nation's rackets by the Italians from the Irish. The fact that the plot was hatched not for New York, but for South Boston, the most Irish place in the US, only makes even more gigantic the Big Lie that was told by the FBI to its ostensible political masters about bringing down organized crime there once and for all. The result, as we all found out, wasn't swapping the heroin of Italian Boston mob violence for Irish methadone. Hoover was, posthumously, swapping it for Oxycontin, or crystal methamphetamine - -- or, more properly, PCP. The absolute psychopathology of violence in Whitey Bulger's crack-cocaine-era reign of Boston's drug markets, like the identical FBI-sponsored reigns or violent horror by other also-rans in cities across the US as a whole, went up whole orders of magnitude, not mere percentage points. As Stalin said once, quantity has a quality all it's own. And, make no mistake, J. Edgar Hoover was directly responsible that ""quality"" of carnage, nation-wide. So, yes, on paper at least, it really *was* just the swapping of one gang of racist thugs for another, and the result was, on paper, at least, business as usual. Same stuff, different century, with apparently decent people like Mr. Salvati et.al accidently ground on the gears of ""justice"" like so much hamburger. However, to be much more macabre about it, that hamburger was ""greasing"", if you will, an auto de fe only a homicidal lunatic could love: a perfectly functioning market, legislated out of existence -- on paper, if nowhere else -- by government fiat and the, back-door, but still elitist, will to power of H.L. Mencken's famous ""bluenoses and busybodies"". It all starts, like all true evil does, from the most innocent of beginnings. What she couldn't do to alcohol, teatotaling Mrs. Grundy then tried to do to anything else she could think of that had a smaller, ""manageable"" demand. The bloody result was, like nine more heads of the hydra, an increasingly ubiquitous universal prohibition, in more markets, and for more things, as the 20th century wore on. Every time some recreational drug was found to be addictive, or harmful, or physically distasteful, or carcinogenic -- or, now, apparently, fattening -- and then prohibited, exactly the same thing happened to its markets that happened to alcohol during the Volstead years. A *larger* market than before the prohibition. Hugely lucrative profits for anyone with the moral stomach to violently scale newly-legislated ""barriers to competition"" imposed on them by the state. Increasingly violent attacks by the government on users of those substances. And, finally, the ultimate in evil -- the kind of evil this country actually fought wars to end -- increasingly coercive axe-handle beatings, by our own government, of the sacred liberty of the average, but now unavoidably-law-breaking, citizenry. As Ayn Rand cynically observed a long time ago, you don't need government if nobody's breaking the law. In some twisted corollary to Parkinson's Law, governments, to survive, *need* more people, breaking more laws, or they can never justify the money they confiscate at tax time. And, to bring us back to the point, David Friedman would probably echo here his father Milton's famous observation that government regulations only benefit the regulated sellers in a given market, and never the consumer, much less the economy as a whole. Even, *especially*, if those sellers are *breaking* the law, as they are in the increasingly ubiquitous prohibition of risky behavior that our government now imposes on us. And there, absent the apparent grace of Mr. Hoover, went Mr. Salvati. In fact, Hayek himself, in ""The Road to Serfdom"", couldn't have predicted any better the gory consequences of Hoover's blatant imposition, ""for our own good"", of Vietnam-era statist power at the neighborhood level. And, furthermore, *Stalin* couldn't have had better ""useful idiots"" than Hoover did -- and neither, by an absolutely literal extension, did Whitey Bulger after Hoover. Useful idiots on both sides of the congressional aisle. Idiots who were eating out of Hoover's power-craven hand for the entire middle of the 20th century -- and Whitey Bulger's hand, whether they knew it or not, until the end of the millennium. A time, you'll notice, which saw the increasingly steady imposition of ""mob"" violence, and market control, from both state and illegal interests, way beyond the imaginings of even the most power-mad, rum-running, stock-kiting, movie-flopping, bureau-pumping, Nazi-appeasing Irish-Bostonian Little Caesar. Or, as for that matter, his safely trust-funded, and now strictly political, descendents. In terms of actual financial economics, think of what happened to Mr. Salvati and the others, dead or alive, as a ""transfer-price"", in human lives, of the inevitable consequence of MacNamara-style Vietnam-era Keynesian ""social-cost"" input-output accounting at its most despicable, and you can almost begin to fathom the atrocity that was committed by Hoover, and his co-religionists in state economic control, in the name of what really was, as you'll now agree, just a race war between thugs up in Boston. This shouldn't be a surprise, really. All race wars are at least fought by thugs, though they're usually conceived elsewhere, and endorsed, at the time, by all the ""right"" people, for all the ""right"" reasons. As far as the FBI itself goes, remember Mancur Olson's observation that a ""prince"" is just a stationary bandit. Though, given his penchant for women's clothing, for other men, and, what's actually obscene, for violently hypocritical treatment of people of his own affectional preference, I suppose we can call J. Edgar Hoover a bandit ""princess"", instead. ""Bandit Queen"", of course, would be a grievous insult to queens -- and real bandits -- everywhere. Cheers, RAH - --------- http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/25/national/25FBI.html?todaysheadlines= &pagewanted=print&position=top The New York Times August 25, 2002 Hoover's F.B.I. and the Mafia: Case of Bad Bedfellows Grows By FOX BUTTERFIELD BOSTON, Aug. 24 - It was March 1965, in the early days of J. Edgar Hoover's war against the Mafia. F.B.I. agents, say Congressional investigators, eavesdropped on a conversation in the headquarters of New England's organized-crime boss, Raymond Patriarca. Two gangsters, Joseph Barboza and Vincent Flemmi, wanted Mr. Patriarca's permission to kill a small-time hoodlum, Edward Deegan, ""as they were having a problem with him,"" according to an F.B.I. log of the conversation. ""Patriarca ultimately furnished this O.K.,"" the F.B.I. reported, and three days later Mr. Deegan turned up dead in an alley, shot six times. It was an extraordinary situation: The Federal Bureau of Investigation had evidence ahead of time that two well-known gangsters were planning a murder and that the head of the New England Mafia was involved. But when indictments in the case were handed down in 1967, the real killers - who also happened to be informers for the F.B.I. - were left alone. Four other men were tried, convicted and sentenced to death or life in prison for the murder, though they had had nothing to do with it. One, Joseph Salvati, who spent 30 years in prison, filed notice with the Justice Department last week that he planned to sue the F.B.I. for $300 million for false imprisonment. His is the latest in a series of lawsuits against the F.B.I., the Justice Department and some F.B.I. agents growing out of the tangled, corrupt collaboration between gangsters and the F.B.I.'s Boston office in its effort to bring down the mob. The lawsuits are based on evidence uncovered in the last five years in a judicial hearing and a Justice Department inquiry. But some of the most explosive evidence has only recently come to light, including documents detailing conversation in which Mr. Patriarca approved the murder. They were released as part of an investigation by the House Committee on Government Reform, which has pressured the department into turning over records about the F.B.I in Boston. The documents show that officials at F.B.I. headquarters, apparently including Mr. Hoover, knew as long ago as 1965 that Boston agents were employing killers and gang leaders as informers and were protecting them from prosecution. ""J. Edgar Hoover crossed over the line and became a criminal himself,"" said Vincent Garo, Mr. Salvati's lawyer. ""He allowed a witness to lie to put an innocent man in prison so he could protect one of his informants."" Mr. Barboza was a crucial witness at trial against Mr. Salvati and may have implicated him because Mr. Salvati owed $400 to a loan shark who worked for Mr. Barboza. Asked about the documents showing that Mr. Hoover knew of Mr. Salvati's innocence when he was put on trial, Gail Marcinkiewicz, a spokeswoman for the F.B.I. in Boston, declined to comment, citing the pending litigation. A Justice Department task force is continuing to investigate misconduct in the Boston office. In one of the first results of the investigation, one retired agent, John J. Connolly, is awaiting sentencing next month after being convicted of racketeering and obstruction of justice for helping two other mob leaders who were F.B.I. informers, James Bulger and Stephen Flemmi. Vincent and Stephen Flemmi are brothers. The Government Reform Committee, led by Representative Dan Burton, Republican of Indiana, has uncovered memorandums from the Boston office to headquarters in Washington revealing the bureau's knowledge that Vincent Flemmi and Mr. Barboza were involved in killing Mr. Deegan. A memorandum a week after the killing described the crime, including who fired the first shot. Then, on June 4, 1965, Mr. Hoover's office demanded to know what progress was being made in developing Vincent Flemmi as an informer. In a reply five days later, the special agent in charge of the Boston office said that Mr. Flemmi was in a hospital recovering from gunshot wounds but because of his connections to Mr. Patriarca ""potentially could be an excellent informant."" The agent also informed Mr. Hoover that Mr. Flemmi was known to have killed seven men, ""and, from all indications, he is going to continue to commit murder."" Nevertheless, the agent said, ""the informant's potential outweighs the risk involved."" A Congressional investigator called the exchange chilling. ""The most frightening part is that after being warned about Flemmi's murders, the director does not even respond,"" the investigator said. ""There is no message not to use a murderer as a government informant."" The origin of the corruption scandal was public and political pressure on Mr. Hoover to move more forcefully against the growing power of the Mafia, which he had largely ignored. In Boston, F.B.I. agents recruited Mr. Barboza and Mr. Flemmi and developed close ties to a rival criminal organization, the Winter Hill Gang, led by Mr. Bulger. Both sides got what they wanted, according to the investigations and the trial of Mr. Connolly. The F.B.I. got information that eventually helped destroy the Patriarca and Angiulo families, which controlled organized crime in New England. Mr. Bulger's gang was able to take over the rackets in Boston, sell drugs and even commit murder while the F.B.I. looked the other way. One reason the F.B.I. may not have used its information about Mr. Patriarca's involvement in the Deegan murder, Congressional investigators say, is that it came from an illegal listening device in his Providence, R.I., headquarters. The F.B.I. agent who transcribed the conversation made it appear that the information was coming from unnamed informants, to disguise the use of the device, the investigators say. Mr. Salvati, a former truck driver, now 69, had his sentence commuted in 1997 by Gov. William F. Weld. Last year, while he was still on parole, his murder conviction was dismissed by a Massachusetts state judge after the Justice Department task force made public documents suggesting his innocence. Two of the other wrongly convicted men died in prison. Their survivors have joined the fourth man, Peter Limone, in a $375 million lawsuit against the Justice Department. Mr. Limone was sentenced to die in the electric chair. His life was spared only when Massachusetts outlawed the death penalty in 1974. Mr. Salvati lives in a modest apartment in Boston's North End with his wife, Marie, who visited him in prison every week during those 30 years. Each week Mr. Salvati sent her a romantic card, which she put on the television set. It was, Mr. Garo said, all they had of each other. -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: PGP 7.5 iQA/AwUBPWmB2sPxH8jf3ohaEQL9qgCgxHq0ee06UEsNv8u8wgvmjf9K7S4An3Rb 3srsGomWjNDwIaKoEHOfNHpI =OELD -----END PGP SIGNATURE----- -- ----------------- R.

What is the reason to write a registry key to a server if the server itself is not using it? I don't think you should worry too much about someone travelling out of the hive, but again, I'm curious as to how the driver actually modifies the keys on the server. > (2) The risks of a compromise to the client (far more likely). This > would probably be by a malformed or extremely long string in the key > value, which would presumably lead to either DOS or system compromise by > buffer overflow on the client system. And if the client writes the key back onto the server, yes, there's wide open for something nasty here. Two other things spring to mind; 1) If anyone can modify the key, how do you make sure that two users are not overwriting the same key, thereby causing undesirable effects. 2) If anyone have permissions to write to the key (and below), anyone can create thousands of extra keys under this key, thereby filling up the registry. The result of such a thing is obvious. If I got this all wrong, I'd be happy that you clarify a bit more and tell me where I might have misunderstood.

This release contains early java libraries and documentation that would primarily be of interest to developers. Talking about documentation, it is still a bit slim and mainly oriented towards people with experience in Java/XML development. There are currently no sample applications, but they will be available in the next release. The framework currently contains the following: - Classes for creating ""Named Objects"", which are authenticated using digital signatures within a hierarchy. - Storage framework for ""Named Objects"". - Simple XML-Signature implementation (Almost certainly not yet interoperable with other implementations) - Simple SOAP client - Simple Servlet API for handling SOAP requests based on ""Named Objects"". - Current types of ""Named Objects"" include: NameSpace objects -- for maintaining the NameSpace Authentication Framework AuthenticationTickets -- for doing web site authentication using digital signatures. Next major release is scheduled to contain: - Core: hard coded root public key, for authenticating top level NameSpaces - Signing Services: Implementation of web based signing services End user hosted signing service - Example User Authentication Application - Example Payment System based on NeuDist I will be expanding the documentation over the next few weeks. This will cover not only more indepth technical documentation, but also higher level documentation about the business side of things.

Typically packages use /usr/local as default (so binaries might then go in /usr/local/bin, documentation in /usr/local/doc and so forth). Normally, I find it sufficient to put --prefix=/usr/local, and do not further specify things like --exec-prefix.

I would use the command ./configure --with-emacs --prefix=/usr/local To get w3 to compile, I think the with-url flag you should use is --with-url=/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/ (Assuming you compiled/installed url with --prefix=/usr/local Since you appear to have installed url in /url/url, configure w3 with ./configure --with-emacs --prefix=/usr/local/ --with-url=/url/url/share/emacs/site-lisp A command you would have found useful would have been find / -name 'url-vars.el' -print Which would have told you where the url-vars.el file was installed. A program which is very useful is checkinstall http://asic-linux.com.mx/~izto/checkinstall/ It allows you to install packages from source while still registering them in the package management system of your distro (rpm,deb,tgz). Instead of ""make install"" type ""checkinstall"", and a package is put together and installed for you. Makes uninstallation simpler than it might otherwise be. -- Michael Conry Ph.:+353-1-7161987, Web: http://www.acronymchile.com Key fingerprint = 5508 B563 6791 5C84 A947 CB01 997B 3598 09DE 502C -- Irish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.

Ben Liblit <liblit@eecs.berkeley.edu>,alsa-driver.spec tweak for homemade kernels,"I use a mostly Red Hat 8.0 system, but prefer to configure and build my kernel by hand. I'd like to humbly offer a tweak to alsa-driver.spec that helps it build cleanly under such circumstances. I recognize that freshrpms.net packages are designed with standard Red Hat in mind, including a standard kernel RPM. However, I hope that Matthias will consider the tweak small enough to justify its incorporation. The diff is attached below. The first part of the diff contains a conditional that checks to see if the expected RPM is installed. If it is, %{karch} is set as before and a new %{krpm} flag is set to 1. If the expected RPM is not installed, then %{karch} is instead set using ""uname -p"", while %{krpm} is left undefined. The second part of the diff is simpler. We only require that kernel-source be installed if the kernel itself came from an RPM. (If the kernel was hand-built, the presumably the user knows enough to have retained the sources in the expected place.) Again, I realize that I'm operating ""off warrantee"" by not using a Red Hat kernel RPM. Matthias, if you think this tweak is reasonable and not too ugly, I'd love to see you pick it up. If not, well at least this message will sit in the archives and may help other folks in the future.",0

It has the ring of something apocraphyl to me, but it's a good read, nevertheless. The U.S. standard railroad gauge (distance between the rails) is 4 feet, 8.5 inches. That is an exceedingly odd number. Why was that gauge used? Because that's the way they built them in England, and the U.S. railroads were built by English expatriates. Why did the English build them that way? Because the first rail lines were built by the same people who built the pre-railroad tramways, and that's the gauge they used. Why did ""they"" use that gauge? Because the people who built the tramways used the same jigs and tools that they used for building wagons, which used that wheel spacing. So why did the wagons have that particular odd spacing? Well, if they tried to use any other spacing, the wagon wheels would break on some of the old, long distance roads in England, because that was the spacing of the wheel ruts...

As soon as I'm in San Francisco for more than a couple days straight, I really think I'm going to pick this up. That's partly because it costs less than half as much as its current competitors -- $199, compared with $450 and up for the others. In the same spirit, T-Mobile will offer unlimited data usage on its new, relatively high- speed ""GPRS"" network for $40 per month -- far below what a serious surfer would likely rack up under competing wireless-data plans. (Voice time is another story -- more on that later.) Another reason I like the Sidekick's prospects: It was designed for, and will be pitched to, a very different market. While vendors of the competing hybrids focus on ""enterprise"" customers -- the big businesses that are supposed to have deep pockets for this sort of thing (even though most clearly don't at this point) -- Danger and T-Mobile are targeting, in their own words, ""Internet-savvy, primarily urban, young adults in the 18- to 34-year-old demographic.""

James Rogers <jamesr@best.com>,Re: Goodbye Global Warming,"I've seen articles on this type of stuff passing through various forums for several years. I've always found archaeology interesting for no particular reason. Here is a recent article from U.S. News that I actually still have in the dank recesses of my virtual repository. -James Rogers jamesr@best.com -------------------------------------------- http://www.usnews.com/usnews/issue/020916/misc/16meltdown.htm Defrosting the past Ancient human and animal remains are melting out of glaciers, a bounty of a warming world BY ALEX MARKELS As he hiked near Colorado's Continental Divide in the summer of 2001, Ed Knapp noticed a strange shape jutting from a melting ice field at 13,000 feet. ""It looked like a bison skull,"" the building contractor and amateur archaeologist recalls. ""I thought, 'That's strange. Bison don't live this high up.' "" Knapp brought the skull to the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, where scientists last month announced that it was indeed from a bison–one that died about 340 years ago. ""This was an extraordinary discovery,"" says Russ Graham, the museum's chief curator, adding that it could alter notions of the mountain environment centuries ago. ""There's probably a lot more like it yet to be found."" And not just bison. Colorado isn't the only place where glaciers and snowfields are melting. Decades of unusual warmth in regions from Peru to Alaska–a trend some think is linked to emissions from cars and industry–have shrunk or thawed many of the world's 70,000 glaciers. As the ice recedes, a treasure-trove of human and animal artifacts is emerging, extraordinarily well preserved after centuries in the deep freeze. The fabrics, wood, bone, and DNA-rich tissue found on the mucky fringes of the ice are revising scientists' understanding of our predecessors' health, habits, and technology, and the prey they pursued. ""It's mind-boggling how many different fields are being advanced through studying these remains,"" says Johan Reinhard, a high-altitude archaeologist and explorer-in-residence at the National Geographic Society. Rare, spectacular finds like the frozen mummies he discovered in the Andes of Peru in the 1990s and the legendary 5,300-year-old ""Ice Man,"" found at the edge of a receding glacier in the Alps in 1991, have offered time capsules of cultural and biological information. Now, as the ice continues to retreat, it is yielding not just occasional treasures but long records of humans and animals in the high mountains. Vanishing act. The trick is finding such specimens before Mother Nature–and looters–take them first. Once uncovered, frozen remains can deteriorate within hours or be gnawed by animals. Moreover, they're often so well preserved when they emerge that people who come upon them don't even realize they're ancient. That was the case when three men hunting sheep near a high glacier in British Columbia, Canada, three years ago saw what they thought was a dead animal. ""It looked a little like sealskin buried in the ice,"" recalls Warren Ward, a teacher from nearby Nelson. ""But when I looked closer I could see leather fringe from a coat and finger bones."" Figuring they had found the remains of another hunter, or perhaps a fur trapper, the men stowed a flint knife and other artifacts in a Zip-Loc bag and delivered them to local officials. Archaeologists later exhumed the fallen hunter's body, along with a woven hat, fur clothing, and what seemed to be a medicine bag. Carbon dating revealed that the hunter lived about 550 years ago. Dubbed Kwaday Dan Ts'inchi, or Long Ago Person Found, by people of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations (who may be his direct descendants), he is perhaps the best-preserved human from the period ever found in North America. Other findings from melting ice in the neighboring Yukon region could explain what that long-ago person was doing in the mountains in the first place. ""Before this there was no archaeological record of people living here,"" says Greg Hare, a Yukon government archaeologist. ""Now we see that this area was very much part of people's seasonal activities."" Like Ward's discovery, the search began by chance, when Kristin Benedek caught a whiff of what smelled like a barnyard as she and her husband, Gerry Kuzyk, hunted sheep at 6,000 feet in the mountains of the south Yukon. They followed the scent to a melting patch of ice covered in caribou dung. ""It was really odd, because I knew there hadn't been caribou in the area for at least 100 years,"" recalls Kuzyk, then a wildlife biologist with the Yukon government. Caribou cake. Returning a week later, he found ""what looked like a pencil with string wrapped around it."" It turned out to be a 4,300-year-old atlatl, or spear thrower. Further investigation of the ice patch–and scores of others around the region–revealed icy layer cakes filled with caribou remains and human detritus chronicling 7,800 years of changing hunting practices. Scientists now believe ancient caribou and other animals flocked to the ice each summer to cool down and escape swarming mosquitoes and flies. Hunters followed the game. They returned for centuries and discarded some equipment in the ice. ""We've got people hunting with throwing darts up until 1,200 years ago,"" says Hare, who now oversees the research project. ""Then we see the first appearance of the bow and arrow about 1,300 years ago. And by 1,200 years ago, there's no more throwing darts."" Now scientists are trying to make the search less a matter of luck. They are developing sophisticated computer models that combine data on where glaciers are melting fastest and where humans and animals are known to have migrated to pinpoint the best places to search in Alaska's Wrangell and St. Elias mountain ranges–the United States' most glaciated terrain–and in the Andes. Johan Reinhard thinks the fast- thawing European Alps could also deliver more findings, perhaps as exquisite as the Ice Man. ""Global warming is providing us high-altitude archaeologists with some fantastic opportunities right now. We're probably about the only ones happy about it.""",0
Gary Lawrence Murphy <garym@canada.com>,Re: ActiveBuddy,"How is this any different from attaching an Infobot or A.L.I.C.E through licq's console-hook? People have been doing that for years, and for over a decade in IRC and the MUDs. ... and the one thing I think we've learned in all that time is that, as a help-desk, it doesn't work. People just don't like talking to robots, especially when the robots, once confused, become imbeciles. I think the humans may feel cheated, deceived and tricked when they discover, as with the Seattle answer, that they are talking to a machine; there's no real intelligence behind that simulated-friendly and therefore empty 'thx'. AIML is clever and cute, but for /practical/ applications as a first line of technical support? It's been tried over and over, and while I /also/ think that it /should/ work, for the most part, people won't use it. What's worse, as we make the NL processing more and more clever, it only means it fails more dramatically; ALICE doesn't just stumble a bit, it starts to drool. And ALICE is the best we have. Like a Dalek: All very impressive when things are going well, but all it takes to betray the chicken-brain inside is a towel over it's ill-placed eye, or a spin off the metal surface ;) In all the prolog-based NL database query systems of the 1980's and other later chatterbot helpdesk projects like Shallow Red, even simpler tries like Ask Jeeves, people very quickly know they're talking to a robot, and the queries anneal to short, truncated and terse database-like verb-noun or just noun-keyword requests. People are just too quick to adapt, and too impatient to forgive a clunky interface, and for now, especially when the /average/ computer user still can't type more than maybe 5-10wpm, NL is a painfully slow clunky interface. Put it this way: Would you login, wake the bot and ask for the Seattle weather, or would you do as we /all/ do and just click the weather icon sitting there on your desktop?

OK, here's a refinement. Assuming very little spam comes through, we only need to pick a small percentage of ham received as new training ham to match the new training spam. The program could randomly select a sufficient number of saved non-spam msgs and ask the user to validate this selection.

I think this should be split up into different numbers of trailing digits, so that rules with different S/O ratios can get different scores. So I've made test rules that look from From names that end with two, three, four, or five digitis, and one for six or more digitis; I also put in a test rule that looks for Froms that end in a single digit, just the sake of completeness.

Which to use really depends on what you're doing with it. Streaming video almost necessitates 802.11a, while streaming just audio can be comfortably done with 802.11b provided that there isn't much interference or too many clients. Prices? Don't know... Haven't done the research. For covering a large area 802.11a will be more expensive due to the need for more APs.

Tim Chapman <timc@2ubh.com>,[zzzzteana] Man admits Soham kidnapping hoax calls,"Ananova: Man admits Soham kidnapping hoax calls A man has admitted making hoax calls to police investigating the disappearance of Soham schoolgirls Jessica Chapman and Holly Wells. Wrexham Magistrates Court, in North Wales, heard jobless Howard Youde made three calls to police in Cambridgeshire claiming to have abducted the youngsters. He was arrested in Wrexham in the early hours of August 16 when officers traced the call to a phone box on the town's Brook Street. The 45-year-old, of Queensway, Hope, near Wrexham, has pleaded guilty to one count of wasting police time on August 15 this year. The court was told Youde claimed to have no recollection of making the calls having been drinking all day. Defence lawyer Mark Arden says the offence was neither premeditated nor calculated but added that this was no excuse. He said: ""What he's done is horrific. It's unforgivable. The distress he's caused the families is unacceptable."" Youde has been released on unconditional bail until November 7 when he will be sentenced. The hearing has been adjourned for pre-sentence reports although the defendant has been warned custody is an option. Story filed: 12:36 Monday 7th October 2002 ------------------------ Yahoo!

You can only have a comment where Tcl would expect to find a command. Switch has a ""pattern - body"" strucutre, so if you goof and put a comment where it is trying to find a pattern, both of you will be confused with the results. The subtlty arises with extra whitespace and newlines.

I'm afraid rebal is quadratic-time in the # of msgs it shuffles around -- since it was only intended to move a few files around, it's dead simple. An easy thing is to start the same way: move all the files into a single directory. Then do random.shuffle() on an os.listdir() of that directory.

Matt Cardier <mcardier@hotmail.com>,[zzzzteana] Compensation for World's youngest mother,"http://www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/americas/08/26/peru.mother.reut/index.html LIMA, Peru (Reuters) -- Lina Medina's parents thought their 5-year-old daughter had a huge abdominal tumor and when shamans in their remote village in Peru's Andes could find no cure, her father carried her to hospital. Just over a month later, she gave birth to a boy. Aged 5 years, seven months and 21 days old when her child was born by Caesarean section in May 1939, Medina made medical history, and is still the youngest known mother in the world. At the time, Peru's government promised aid that never materialized. Six decades on, Medina lives with her husband in a cramped house in a poor, crime-ridden district of the Peruvian capital known as ""Little Chicago."" Now 68, she keeps herself to herself and has long refused requests to rake up the past. Gerardo, the son she delivered while still a child herself, died in 1979 at the age of 40. But a new book, written by an obstetrician who has been interested in her case, has drawn fresh attention to Medina's story, and raised the prospect that the Peruvian government may belatedly offer her financial and other assistance. ""The government condemned them to live in poverty. In any other country, they would be the objects of special care,"" Jose Sandoval, author of ""Mother Aged 5,"" told Reuters. ""We still have time to repair the damage done to her. That's my fundamental objective,"" he added. 'Totally willing to help' Sandoval has raised Medina's case with the office of first lady Eliane Karp, and has asked the government to grant her a life pension -- something officials say is possible. ""We're totally willing to help her,"" said spokeswoman Marta Castaneda. But Suni Ramos, of the social action department of Karp's office, said that before the government could grant her a pension or any other of the aid it was already planning -- such as kitchen and other household equipment -- it needed to talk to her to discuss what she wanted and needed. It is currently trying to contact Medina and her family. Medina's husband, Raul Jurado, told Reuters his wife remained skeptical. ""She got no help (in 1939) that I know about,"" he said. ""She thinks governments never deliver. Maybe today there will be a promise that will never come true."" Jurado said his wife, whose story is a medical textbook classic and whose case is confirmed as true by such bodies as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, had turned down Reuters' request for an interview. Medical rarity No one has ever established who was the father of Medina's child, or confirmed she became pregnant after being raped. One of nine children born to country folk in Ticrapo, an Andean village at an altitude of 7,400 feet (2,250 meters) in Peru's poorest province, Medina is believed to be the youngest case of precocious puberty in history, Sandoval said. He said she had her first period at 2 1/2, became pregnant aged 4 years and eight months and that when doctors performed the Caesarean to deliver her baby, they found she already had fully mature sexual organs. Her swelling stomach worried her parents. ""They thought it was a tumor,"" he said. But shamans ruled out village superstitions -- including one in which locals believed a snake grew inside a person until it killed them -- and recommended they take her to hospital in the nearest big town, Pisco. There came the staggering diagnosis that she was pregnant. Her father was jailed temporarily on suspicion of incest -- he was later released for lack of evidence -- and doctors, police and even a film crew set off for her village for preliminary investigations into her case. Sandoval, who based his book on media and other published information, and some interviews with relatives as Medina herself declined to comment, said news of the child mother-to-be drew instant offers of aid, including one worth $5,000 from a U.S. businessman, which was turned down. More offers followed after Medina was transferred to a Lima hospital, where her fully developed 6-pound (2.7 kg) baby was born on May 14, 1939 -- Mother's Day. One offer was worth $1,000 a week, plus expenses, for Medina and her baby to be exhibited at the World's Fair in New York. Another, from a U.S. business that the family accepted in early June 1939, was for the pair to travel to the United States for scientists to study the case. The offer included setting up a fund to ensure their lifelong financial comfort. But within days, the state trumped all previous offers, decreeing that Medina and her baby were in ""moral danger,"" and resolving to set up a special commission to protect them. But Sandoval said: ""It abandoned the case after six months ...It did absolutely nothing for them."" Happy ending? Though physically mature, Medina -- who Sandoval said was mentally normal and showed no other unusual medical symptoms -- still behaved like a child, preferring to play with her dolls instead of the new baby, who was fed by a wet nurse. Medina stayed in hospital for 11 months, finally returning to her family after it began legal proceedings that led to a Supreme Court ruling allowing her to live with them again. After taunting from schoolmates, Gerardo -- who was named after one of the doctors who attended Medina and became their mentor -- discovered when he was 10 that the woman he had grown up believing to be his sister was in fact his mother. He died in 1979 from a disease that attacks the body's bone marrow, but Sandoval said it was not clear there was any link with his illness and the fact his mother had been so young. Medina married and in 1972 had a second son, 33 years after her first. Her second child now lives in Mexico. She appears to have turned her bizarre story into a taboo subject. ""We just want to get on with our lives, that's it,"" said Jurado, adding he thought ""absolutely nothing"" of the fact his wife was the world's youngest mother. He said the couple's main concern now, if the government's offer of aid was genuine, was to be granted the value of a property that belonged to Medina and which the then-government expropriated more than two decades ago. That house has now been destroyed and there is a road on the site. He said its value was ""more or less $25,000"" and settling the property question would conclude a long legal battle to get back a home of their own -- they live now in a modest house, accessed down a dingy alley half blocked by a wooden board, in a tough neighborhood known to locals as a thieves' paradise. ""If the government really wants to help...they should give us the value of our property,"" he said. As for Sandoval, he said he was optimistic that Medina's story, which he has studied since his student days, would turn out well. ""I believe there will be a happy ending,"" he said. ""As a result of the war, corporations have now been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places will follow and the money-power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed.""

What do you mean by ""CD-Key or the like"" (I presume that ""of"" was a typo)? And what do you mean by ""unbreakable""? You need to be far more explicit about the problem which you wish to solve, and about the constraints involved. Some general points: 1. For a conventional ""CD key"" system, where the actual CDs are mass-produced (where you have many identical CDs), and the entire system has to work offline, you cannot solve the problem of valid keys being ""traded"" (e.g. included along with bootleg copies of the product). If there's an online element involved, you can ""tie"" keys to a specific hardware configuration, as is done (AFAIK) for Windows XP's ""product activation"". 2. Anything which uses a symmetric cipher (or hash) is bound to be vulnerable to reverse engineering of the validation routines within the executable. 3. Ultimately, any software mechanism will be vulnerable to ""cracking"", i.e. modifying the software to disable or circumvent the validation checks. This can only be prevented by the use of trusted hardware (e.g. a Palladium-style system). Most significantly, the data must be supplied in a form which is only accessible by that hardware. If anyone can get at the data in a meaningful (i.e. unencrypted) form, they can extract the useful parts and discard the rest (i.e. any associated protection mechanisms). IOW, you have to ""keep the genie in the bottle"" at all times. If the data can be got at just once (even if it requires the use of dedicated hardware such as a bus analyser), it can then be duplicated and distributed without limit. -- Glynn Clements <glynn.clements@virgin.net>",0

bmord@icon-nicholson.com,use of base image / delta image for automated recovery from attacks,"Hi, I was inspired by a mode of operation supported by VMWare. You can have a base disk image shared by multiple virtual machine (vm) instances. That base image is never altered by a vm instance. Instead, each vm instance writes changes to its own ""redo"" log. Future hard disk reads from that vm instance incorporate both the base image and the appropriate redo log to present the current disk image for that specific virtual machine. This is described here (thanks to Duane for providing this link on the honeypots mailing list) http://www.vmware.com/support/reference/common/disk_sharing.html Could this basic concept be used to easily make self-fixing client/server applications that efficiently and automatically recover from most attacks, even before those attacks have been discovered? Here is what I imagine. The physical architectures of most production client/server systems are layered. For example, your basic web application might have a web server running Apache, connected to an application server running some J2EE or .Net business logic, connected to a database server for persistence. The only one of these whose disk image really should evolve over time is the database server, and even here you often put the static RDBMS software on one partition and the changeable datafiles on another partition. It is only the partition with the volatile datafiles that must be allowed to change from one boot to the next. Other paritions may need to be writable for, say, swap space, but these changes could be eliminated on each reboot. When someone cracks this system, they will probably change an image that shouldn't be changed. E.g., they might leverage a buffer overflow in IIS or Apache to install a trojan or a backdoor on the more exposed web server. But what if the web server ran off a base image, writing changes to a ""delta"" or ""redo"" partition? And then what if every night it automatically erased the redo partition and rebooted? The downtime involved for each machine would be minimal, because it is only deleting data - rather than restoring from backup. In a system with redundant web servers for load balancing or high availability, this could be scheduled in a way such that the system is always accessible. This base/redo partition concept could be implemented at the same level as a feature of hardware RAID, allowing for greater performance, reliability, and hack resistance. This concept could also be applied to the application servers, and even the database server partitions (except for those partitions which contain the table data files, of course.) Does anyone do this already? Or is this a new concept? Or has this concept been discussed before and abandoned for some reasons that I don't yet know? I use the physical architecture of a basic web application as an example in this post, but this concept could of course be applied to most server systems. It would allow for the hardware-separation of volatile and non-volatile disk images. It would be analogous to performing nightly ghosting operations, only it would be more efficient and involve less (or no) downtime. Thanks for any opinions, Ben",0

Remove all the PCI & ISA/EISA cards. Remove the floppy disk cable from the mobo, the ide cables from the mobo... essentially leaving only a video card... ram and a keyboard plugged in. Turn on the system. If it doesn't POST then, switch it off and remove the video card. Switch it back on ... if your mobo doesn't emit some beeps complaining about lack of video card then. Switch it off. Remove it's ram. Same procedure as above. If you still don't have any kind of mobo beep codes then you can try as a last ditch effort to reseat the cpu... (remembering to never ever ever power up your system without a heatsink & fan). If after reseating the cpu into the mobo... you still get no beep codes, from it with just the cpu inserted into the mobo ie(no pci,*isa cards or and no actual ide or floppy cables connected to the system)... even though you have power... you either have a faulty motherboard or a faulty cpu. Once you get beep codes various permutations of the above should eventually disjunct which device it is, is causing the lack of POST. Power On Self Test.

What's wrong with a release tag of fr1? Say you have installed synaptic-0.24-fr1 on your Valhalla box (package rebuilt for Valhalla). Then you upgrade to Psyche using the Red Hat CDs. Hopefully with the compat libraries the package will still be there (although I doubt that since C++ is binary incompatible, so this is probably a bad example), then you ""apt-get update"" with the new Psyche repository... and there's where the problem will be : It will say that there are two synaptic-0.24-fr1 packages (one installed, the other available) with the same version but different dependencies :-/ That's why I always keep package versions lower for older distributions.

Writing an IMAP server is a non-trivial task. The specification is huge and clients do all kinds of weird stuff. POP is very easy in comparison.

Alternatively, perhaps there could be a separate protocol and client that could be used to review additions to the training set.

joelonsoftware <rssfeeds@example.com>,Feedback from my posting about FogBUGZ Setup fell into four categories. *,"URL: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/20021008.html Date: Not supplied Feedback from my posting[1] about FogBUGZ[2] Setup fell into four categories. *""Why make Setup reversable? Instead you should collect all the information from the user and make all the changes in one batch at the end.""* There are a couple of things to understand here. First of all, even if you do everything in one batch at the end, there's always a possibility that some step in the middle of the batch will fail, and in that case, a well-behaved setup program will back out the steps that were already done. There are well over 100 error messages in the string table for FogBUGZ Setup so the number of things that can fail is not insignificant. Second, it's not nice to tell people about an error in their input three pages after they made the mistake. For example, early in the FogBUGZ setup process we prompt you to create an account for FogBUGZ to use: [IMG: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/pictures/setupNewAcct.gif (FogBUGZ Setup Screenshot)] The account creation could fail for a myriad of reasons, none of which can be predicted before trying to create the account. For example, the password might not conform to the system password policy. And different national versions of Windows NT have different rules about accented letters in passwords (betcha didn't know that!). It's better to tell the user about this problem right away so they can correct their input rather than having a message come up during the long install process later, forcing the user to back up and fix it. And even if you force the user to back up and fix it, you still have to undo the first part of the work that you did before creating the account, otherwise you've left their system in an indeterminate state. In any case I need to write code to create the account and delete the account in case something later fails; I might as well call that code on this page of the wizard where I can display a useful error message. And what are the kinds of things that need to be reversable? Well, in order to upgrade FogBUGZ without requiring a reboot (and we _never, ever _require a reboot), we have to shut down a couple of processes that might have been keeping FogBUGZ files pinned down, such as IIS (Microsoft's web server). So part one of the batch is ""Stop IIS."" Now if part 2 fails for some reason, it would be _extremely_ rude to leave IIS not running. And anyway, it's not like I don't need to write the code for ""Start IIS"" for the end of the batch. So the code to rollback ""Stop IIS"" is already written. No big deal, I just need to call it at the right place. I think one reason that people think you should ""gather all the info and then do all the work"" is because with very large installation programs that are very slow, this is a polite way to waste less of the user's time. Indeed even FogBUGZ setup does 95% of its work at the very end. But the ""create account"" operation is so fast, that principle simply doesn't apply here. Even our 95% of the work phase takes well under a minute, most of which is spent waiting for IIS to stop and start. *""Why did you use VC++/MFC? Surely an advanced intelligence such as yourself has admitted by now that Delphi[3] is more productive.""* First of all, leave your language religious fanaticism at the Usenet door. Somehow I managed to figure out_ in high school_ that language advocacy and religious arguments are unbelievably boring. Secondly, even if Delphi were more productive, the only pertinent question, since I am writing the code, is _what is more productive for Joel Spolsky_. And I don't know Delphi at all, but I know Win32, MFC, and VC++ _really, really well_. So while I might not outcode a good Delphi programmer, I would definitely outcode a completely inexperienced Delphi programmer (which is me), certainly over a short 4 week project. Third, many of the things I needed to do in this setup program are things like ""grant the Logon as Service privilege to an account."" This is rare enough that the only way to find out how to do this is to search the Microsoft knowlege base and the web in general. When you search the web in general for how to do fancy things with Windows NT, what you find is about 75% C code, maybe 20% VB code, and 5% everything else. Yes, I know, I could translate the C code into Delphi (assuming I was a sophisticated Delphi programmer, not a completely inexperienced Delphi programmer), but that costs as much productivity as I would supposedly gain from your supposedly more productive programming language. And fourth, I already had about 30% of the code I needed for Setup in MFC format: from FogBUGZ 2.0 Setup, and a library I've been using for years to make wizards. *""Why make Setup at all? You already have your customers' money. Good Setup programs don't increase sales.""* This was actually the smartest question and made me think the hardest. I came up with three reasons: - Decreased tech support cost. This setup program will pay for itself over the life of the code. - Delight my customers. When I'm trying to get them to upgrade to 4.0, I want them to remember how painless the 3.0 installation was, so they won't hesitate because they are afraid to upgrade. I'm still using an old version of SpamAssassin that is becoming increasingly ineffective, even though I know the new version is much better, because I just can't bear the thought of another morning wasted. The very memory of the first SpamAssassin installation -- all the little SSH windows, some su'ed, trying to scroll through man pages and Google Groups, accidentally hitting Ctrl+Z in Emacs to undo and having it suspend, trying to guess why we can't get the MTA to run procmail, sorry it's too much. If SpamAssassin was making money off of upgraders they would have lost my business because they don't have a SETUP program. - Win reviews. Software reviewers always cast about for some kind of standardized way to rate software, even when they are comparing apples and oranges and planets and 17th century philosophers. They always have a meaningless list of things to review which can be applied to PC games, mainframe databases, web site auction software, and DNA sequencing software. And Setup is always on their list.

Rohit Khare <khare@alumni.caltech.edu>,CBS News' interview w/Bush & reconstruction of his peregrinations,"""60 Minutes II"" Bush Interview: (CBS) No president since Abraham Lincoln has seen such horrific loss of life in a war on American soil. No president since James Madison, nearly 200 years ago, has seen the nation’s capital city successfully attacked. But, one year ago, President George W. Bush was thrown into the first great crisis of the 21st century. This is the president’s story of September 11th and the week America went to war. 60 Minutes II spent two hours with Mr. Bush, one, on Air Force One and another in the Oval Office last week. Even after a year, the president is still moved, sometimes to the point of tears, when he remembers Sept. 11. “I knew, the farther we get away from Sept.11, the more likely it is for some around the world to forget the mission, but not me,” Mr. Bush says during the Air Force One interview. “Not me. I made the pledge to myself and to people that I’m not going to forget what happened on Sept. 11. So long as I’m president, we will pursue the killers and bring them to justice. We owe that to those who have lost their lives.” The memories come back sharp and clear on Air Force One, where Pelley joined the president for a recent trip across country. 60 Minutes II wanted to talk to him there because that is where he spent the first hours after the attack. Not since Lyndon Johnson was sworn in on Air Force One has the airplane been so central to America in a crisis. For President Bush, Sept. 11 2001, started with the usual routine. Before dawn, the president was on his four-mile run. It was just before 6 a.m. and, at the same moment, another man was on the move: Mohammad Atta. Two hours later, as Mr. Bush drove to an elementary school, hijackers on four planes were murdering the flight crews and turning the airliners east. As the motorcade neared the school at 8:45 a.m., jet engines echoed in Manhattan. Atta plunged the 767 jumbo jet into World Trade Center Tower One. “I thought it was an accident,” says Mr. Bush. “I thought it was a pilot error. I thought that some foolish soul had gotten lost and - and made a terrible mistake.” Mr. Bush was told about the first plane just before sitting down with a class of second graders. He was watching a reading drill when, just after nine, United Flight 175 exploded into the second tower. There was the sudden realization that what had seemed like a terrible mistake was a coordinated attack. Back in the Florida classroom, press secretary Ari Fleischer got the news on his pager. The president’s chief-of-staff, Andy Card stepped in. “A second plane hit the second tower; America is under attack,” Card told the president When he said those words, what did he see in the President’s face? “I saw him coming to recognition of what I had said,” Card recalls. “I think he understood that he was going to have to take command as commander-in-chief, not just as president.” What was going through Bush’s mind when he heard the news? “We’re at war and somebody has dared attack us and we’re going to do something about it,” Mr. Bush recalls. “I realized I was in a unique setting to receive a message that somebody attacked us, and I was looking at these little children and all of the sudden we were at war. I can remember noticing the press pool and the press corps beginning to get the calls and seeing the look on their face. And it became evident that we were, you know, that the world had changed.” Mr. Bush walked into a classroom set up with a secure phone. He called the vice president, pulling the phone cord tight as he spun to see the attack on TV. Then he grabbed a legal pad and quickly wrote his first words to the nation. ""Ladies and gentlemen, this is a difficult moment for America,” he said in the speech. “Today, we’ve had a national tragedy.” It was 9:30 a.m. As he spoke, Mr. Bush didn’t know that two more hijacked jets were streaking toward Washington. Vice Pesident Dick Cheney was in his office at the White House when a Secret Service agent ran in. “He said to me, ‘Sir, we have to leave immediately’ and grabbed, put a hand on my belt, another hand on my shoulder and propelled me out the door of my office,” Cheney recalls. “I’m not sure how they do it, but they sort of levitate you down the hallway, you move very fast.” “There wasn’t a lot of time for chitchat, you know, with the vice president,” says Secret Service Director Brian Stafford, who was in his command center ordering the round-up of top officials and the First Family. He felt that he had only minutes to work with. “We knew there were unidentified planes tracking in our direction,” he says. Cheney was rushed deep under the White House into a bunker called the Presidential Emergency Operations Center. It was built for war, and this was it. On her way down, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice called Mr. Bush. “It was brief because I was being pushed to get off the phone and get out of the West Wing,” says Rice. “They were hurrying me off the phone with the president and I just said, he said, ‘I’m coming back’ and we said ‘Mr. President that may not be wise.’ I remember stopping briefly to call my family, my aunt and uncle in Alabama and say, ‘I’m fine. You have to tell everybody that I’m fine’ but then settling into trying to deal with the enormity of that moment, and in the first few hours, I think the thing that was on everybody’s mind was how many more planes are coming.” The Capitol was evacuated. And for the first time ever, the Secret Service executed the emergency plan to ensure the presidential line of succession. Agents swept up the 15 officials who stood to become president if the others were killed. They wanted to move Vice President Cheney, fearing he was in danger even in the bunker. But Cheney says when he heard the other officials were safe, he decided to stay at the White House, no matter what. “It’s important to emphasize it's not personal, you don’t think of it in personal terms, you’ve got a professional job to do,” says Cheney. Cheney was joined by transportation secretary Norm Mineta who remembers hearing the FAA counting down the hijacked jets closing in on the capital. Says Mineta: “Someone came in and said ‘Mr. Vice president there’s a plane 50 miles out,’ then he came in and said ‘Its now 10 miles out, we don’t know where it is exactly, but it’s coming in low and fast.’” It was American Flight 77. At 9:38 a.m., it exploded into the Pentagon, the first successful attack on Washington since the War of 1812. As the Pentagon burned, Mr. Bush’s limousine sped toward Air Force One in Florida. At that moment, United Flight 93 - the last hijacked plane - was taking dead aim at Washington. At the White House, the staff was in the West Wing cafeteria, watching on TV. Press Secretary Jennifer Millerwise was in the crowd when the order came to evacuate. “I no sooner walked outside when someone from the Secret Service yelled ‘Women drop your heels and run, drop your heels and run,’ and suddenly the gates that never open except for authorized vehicles just opened and the whole White House just flooded out,” she recalls. In Florida, as Mr. Bush boarded Air Force One, he was overheard telling a Secret Service agent “Be sure to get the First Lady and my daughters protected.” At 9:57 a.m., Air Force One thundered down the runway, blasting smoke and dust in a full -hrust take off. Communications Director Dan Bartlett was on board. “It was like a rocket,” he remembers. “For a good ten minutes, the plane was going almost straight up.” At the same moment, 56 minutes after it was hit, World Trade Center Tower Two began to falter, then cascade in an incomprehensible avalanche of steel, concrete and human lives. “Someone said to me, ‘Look at that’ I remember that, ‘Look at that’ and I looked up and I saw and I just remember a cloud of dust and smoke and the horror of that moment,” recalls Rice of the TV newscast. She also felt something in her gut: “That we’ve lost a lot of Americans and that eventually we would get these people. I felt the anger. Of course I felt the anger.” Down in the bunker, Cheney was trying to figure out how many hijacked planes there were. Officials feared there could be as many as 11. As the planes track toward Washington, a discussion begins about whether to shoot them down. “I discussed it with the president,” Cheney recalls. “‘Are we prepared to order our aircraft to shoot down these airliners that have been hijacked?’ He said yes.” “It was my advice. It was his decision,” says Cheney. “That’s a sobering moment to order your own combat aircraft to shoot down your own civilian aircraft,” says Bush. “But it was an easy decision to make given the – given the fact that we had learned that a commercial aircraft was being used as a weapon. I say easy decision, it was, I didn’t hesitate, let me put it that way. I knew what had to be done.” The passengers on United Flight 93 also knew what had to be done. They fought for control and sacrificed themselves in a Pennsylvania meadow. The flight was 15 minutes from Washington. “Clearly, the terrorists were trying to take out as many symbols of government as they could: the Pentagon, perhaps the Capitol, perhaps the White House. These people saved us not only physically but they saved us psychologically and symbolically in a very important way, too,” says Rice. Meanwhile, Tower One was weakening. It had stood for an hour and 43 minutes. At 10:29 a.m., it buckled in a mirror image of the collapse of its twin. The image that went round the world reached the First Lady in a secure location somewhere in Washington. “I was horrified,” she says. “I thought, ‘Dear God, protect as many citizens as you can.’ It was a nightmare.” By 10:30 a.m., America’s largest city was devastated, its military headquarters were burning. Air force One turned west along the Gulf Coast. “I can remember sitting right here in this office thinking about the consequences of what had taken place and realizing it was the defining moment in the history of the United States,” says President Bush. “I didn’t need any legal briefs, I didn’t need any consultations, I knew we were at war.” Mr. Bush says the first hours were frustrating. He watched the horrifying pictures, but the TV signal was breaking up. His calls to Cheney were cutting out. Mr. Bush says he pounded his desk shouting, “This is inexcusable; get me the vice president.” “I was trying to clear the fog of war, and there is a fog of war, says the president. ""Information was just flying from all directions.” Chief of staff Card brought in the reports. There was word Camp David had been hit. A jet was thought to be targeting Mr. Bush’s ranch. “I remember hearing that the State Department might have been hit, or that the White House had a fire in it. So we were hearing lots of different information,” says Card. They also feared that Air Force One itself was a target. Cheney told the president there was a credible threat against the plane. Using the code name for Air Force One, Mr. Bush told an aide, “Angel is next.” The threat was passed to presidential pilot Colonel Mark Tillman. “It was serious before that but now it is -no longer is it a time to get the president home,” Tillman says. “We actually have to consider everything we say, everything we do could be intercepted, and we have to make sure that no one knows what our position is.” Tillman asked for an armed guard at his cockpit door while Secret Service agents double-checked the identity of everyone on board. The crew reviewed the emergency evacuation plan. Then came a warning from air traffic control – a suspect airliner was dead ahead. “Coming out of Sarasota there was one call that said there was an airliner off our nose that they did not have contact with,” Tillman remembers. Tillman took evasive action, pulling his plane high above normal traffic. They were on course for Washington, but by now no one thought that was a good idea, except the president. “I wanted to come back to Washington, but the circumstances were such that it was just impossible for the Secret Service or the national security team to clear the way for Air Force One to come back,” says Bush. So Air Force One set course for an underground command center in Nebraska. Back in Washington, the president’s closest advisor, Karen Hughes, heard about the threat to the plane and placed a call to Mr. Bush. “And the military operator came back to me and in a voice that, to me, sounded very shaken said, ‘Ma’am, I’m sorry, we can’t reach Air Force One.’” Hughes recalls. Hughes was out of the White House during the attacks. When she came back, it was a place she didn’t recognize. “There were either military, or maybe Secret Service, dressed all in black, holding machine guns as, as we drove up. And I never expected to see something like that in, in our nation's capital,” says Hughes. When she walked into the White House, no one was inside. “I knew it was a day that you didn't want to surprise anybody, and so I yelled, ‘Hello?’ and two, again, kind of SWAT team members came running, running through the, the hall with, again, guns drawn, and then took me to, to the location where I met the vice president.”",0

Steve Nordquist <signa@birch.net>,UAE/Ami*/Linux Laptop: Important details.,"Well, for one, it would free up the similar laptop I already got to just run Amithlon (or if that wasn't so fun, bsd) to run just OpenBSD! This is a near-term thing I could look forward to! However, an 'official' laptop seems unexciting to me with only the items mentioned. Most important are the particulars distinguishing the listed spec from a Dell 2650, preferably: 1- GeForce4 440 Go or newer, pleasingly modern GPU; the GeForce2Go (with 16MB video RAM; too little) I have is not so much too slow as inefficient; with factory settings it would actually crash from running too hot and too fast. (Accelerating the Ami* and possibly OpenUAE graphics is a necessity to meet for good speed in those environments, but an energy-efficient GPU is a good sideeffect and portability (read: battery lifetime) enabler.) 1.5- Great control over CPU state; by use of 'internet keys' wired to BIOS/bhipset routines directly or preferably a scroll wheel. Also, hibernate that works, please. 1.7- Bootable to USB 2.0 drives (e.g. larger external ones) in BIOS, please. 2- P4 Dells overheat. They have a big heatsink and a little fan to pull air through it, and if you don't elevate thelaptop off the desk or table or bed it's on, the fan will -stay- on. Not good for MTBS (mean time between service; unless you've got an angle on making money on service from Amigans.....) One excellent solution is to include a heatpipe which runs behind the AMLCD, thus using the backside of the display half as a radiator.; though it interferes with the case notion below. (yes, Aavid or such makes some as a standard part.) I prefer to include the heatpipe but employ the radiative mass in elevating the laptop (i.e. in the form of a catch-handle and second logo device behind the laptop, which generally provides stow and attachment for elevation legs (move them out farther to get to the next-higher ekevation, until the sides of the laptop are met.) This also happens to provide a little protection for USB 2 and 1394 cables that I tend to keep plugged in all the time (a bit longer port life? Please.) 3- A case color other than brown or black, and preferably (if the display module NRE is entirely permissive) the capability to -run with the backlight off.- Again, to save battery power, but also as a feature; maybe you remember the iBooks modified in this manner. The user has the privilege to pull out the backlight diffuser and fiberoptic lightpipe/CF assembly, with its backreflector, and the whole warrantee. This provides for excellent outdoor use, often with the diffuser reinserted to keep depth-of-field distractions minimised. What would I like? A1200 putty color, any translucency, in or over a rosewood-colored (in KDE color browser, I see chocolate, firebrick and a couple of 'indian red' that are great candidates) base. I would also like to be able to at least turn off the backlight without closing the lid, and to be -able- to fit an -external- light source such as a UV-filtered solar collector (and glare hood) to feed into the backlight. Not only does this make an excellent color environment but lets one work outdoors tolerably. The logo should be a coloration of a minimal surface, as the MAA is trying to get me to renew with: demos at http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/pbourke/geometry/ at first blush. We'll see what comes out of the contest and maybe you'll like the mapping MathCAD does of the logo to a minimal surface or manifold that reflects the openness of AmigaOS, Ami* and Amiga community. MAA.org has more references, I'm sure. 4- Obviously Elfin details., e,g, the backlight inlet. Other details: USB2.x preferred; FireWire would be needed if that's unavailable. Options like 802.11b or attabhable WiFi hub for ethernet port should round out the offering. An option for just-released .13 micron P4 (with mobile power features) could make more reviewers greenlight the series; much better power consumption, and almost certainly a higher a top clock come with that. CompactFlash, SmartMedia and MMC flash memory card interfaces would be very pleasant. I've mentioned booting to USB, and booting from CF would be a pleasant extigency also. To that end, a backup solution with compression using USB 2 storage or the multimode drive is always a nice bundle item; that or a chance to back out a patch under 3 OS..... Blue skies (and clear water and fresh air): Waterproof to 30 feet, 3 Ethernet ports plus onboard WiFi. Svelte; 3-line frontpanel LCD and bright red pager LED, builtin G4 cellphone functions, choice of side and frontpanel trim: Ivory-like stuff inscribed with M68k memory map and various OS 3.9 structures or textured fur that says 'This is Amiga Speaking' when stroked 'round. Decent keyboard, as in Toshiba or IBM laptops; perhaps an ergonomic fingerworks.com device (they work as keyboard and mouse) as the keyboard/trackpad. 2 Directional planar mics atop AMLCD; soundcard with multiple 18 bit A-D and noise reduction DSP that work in our (second-through-fourth, at least) favorite OS. Actual 7"" bellows pulls out at nominal ventilation fan location for real void-comp (the test in Blade Runner) style cooling and extended bass; active cooling and airfiltering is available to adjust humidity at user seat and provide mineral water. HyperTransport ports.",0

Owen --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- http://www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/news/opinion/3900215.htm Internet can level the political playing field By Mike McCurry and Larry Purpuro NOT many months from now, people across the country will experience one of the great recurring features of American democracy. At shopping malls, on factory floors, at church socials and even on our front stoops, we will be approached by individuals who want to represent us in public office. While chances are high that we won't know them personally, they will walk up to us, offer a handshake and a flier and ask for our votes. Just as technology is affecting every other area of communication, it has begun to affect the way political candidates communicate with voters. In this year's GOP gubernatorial primary, California Secretary of State Bill Jones, who faced better-funded candidates, acquired the e-mail addresses of more than a million potential California voters and sent each an unsolicited e-mail asking for support. That day, he might have chosen any of the more traditional -- and more expensive -- methods of contacting voters, such as direct mail, radio spots or TV ads. But he spent only about 2 cents per message, instead of 35 cents or more per message for direct mail or in another medium. Had Jones chosen direct mail, radio or TV, that communication would have been equally ``unsolicited,'' as defined in the e-mail world. Few voters would have ``opted in'' to receive campaign information from Jones through any of those channels. The response to Jones' e-mail effort, however, was swift and intense. He was lambasted by anti-spam advocates, and media coverage was almost entirely negative. To be fair, some of Jones' tactics could have been refined. He used a less-than-perfect list and no standard-practice ``paid for'' disclaimer in the message. His detractors, however, attacked him not for his tactical miscues but because the e-mail was sent unsolicited. In fact, Jones' online campaign may have been his most visible asset. In an era of cynicism toward money in politics -- money typically spent on other unsolicited communication mediums -- Jones tried to level the playing field. No one likes commercial spam. It is irrelevant and untargeted and can be highly intrusive and even offensive. But as a sophisticated society, it's time to differentiate commercial spam from very different unsolicited e-mail sent by political candidates to voters. The debate is particularly relevant in light of legislation in Congress that would constitute the first federal law to directly address spam. We believe e-mail is no more intrusive than direct mail, telemarketing or TV advertising when it comes to politicians seeking to reach voters. A simple link in good e-mail campaigns allows recipients to opt out of future mailings. Direct mail takes at least a phone call or stamp to be taken off a list, and viewers must repeatedly endure TV ads. When a candidate lacks a large campaign war chest, he or she can use the Internet to provide constituents with information to better prepare them to perform their civic duty of casting educated votes. With more than 60 percent of all potential voters in this country possessing e-mail accounts, it makes sense that political candidates use this medium. Candidates might avoid some of the tactical problems encountered by the Jones campaign if they use the technologies available today that better ensure quality of e-mail lists and target content to specific recipient groups. But the broader point remains. When a political candidate sends a voter an e-mail, that recipient can choose to delete the message without opening it, unsubscribe from the list, read it or even reply and engage the sender. That choice should belong to the voter -- not to anti-spam advocates whose efforts are better focused on commercial e-mail. Political candidates should be free to communicate with voters as best they can, and let voters decide what to do with that information. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mike McCurry, former press secretary for President Clinton, is CEO of an advocacy management and communications software company.

"""R. A. Hettinga"" <rah@shipwright.com>",Rebuild at Ground Zero,"http://online.wsj.com/article_print/0,,SB10327475102363433,00.html The Wall Street Journal September 23, 2002 COMMENTARY Rebuild at Ground Zero By LARRY SILVERSTEIN Earlier this month, we New Yorkers observed the solemn anniversary of the horrific events that befell our city on Sept. 11, 2001. All of those who perished must never be forgotten. The footprints of the fallen Twin Towers and a portion of the 16-acre site must be dedicated to a memorial and civic amenities that recall the sacrifices that were made there and the anguish that those senseless acts of terror created for the victims' families and, indeed, for all of us. But for the good of the city and the region, the 10-million-plus square feet of commercial and retail space that was destroyed with the Twin Towers must be replaced on the site. About 50,000 people worked in the World Trade Center. Those jobs are lost, along with those of another 50,000 people who worked in the vicinity. Together, those jobs in lower Manhattan, for which the Trade Center was the economic stimulus, produced annual gross wages of about $47 billion, or 15% of the annual gross wages earned in the entire state. Some of the firms have relocated elsewhere in the city and region, but many have not. New York City is facing a budget deficit. Without additional jobs, the deficit may become permanent. This is one reason for the importance of rebuilding. If we do not replace the lost space, lower Manhattan never will regain the vibrancy it had as the world's financial center. Love them or hate them, and there were lots of New Yorkers on both sides of the issue, the Towers made a powerful statement to the world that said, ""This is New York, a symbol of our free economy and of our way of life."" That is why they were destroyed. This is a second reason why the towers must be replaced, and with buildings that make a potent architectural statement. In recent weeks, redevelopment proposals have been circulated from many sources. Most of these focus not on the Trade Center site, however, but on all of lower Manhattan. Further, many believe that the 10 million square feet either could be located elsewhere, scattered in several sites, or simply never rebuilt. These proposals miss the point. What was destroyed, and what must be recovered, was the Trade Center, not all of lower Manhattan. Except over the towers' footprints, where there must be no commercial development, the office and retail space lost has to be rebuilt on or close to where it was. Access to mass transit makes the site ideal for office space of this size. That was a major reason why the Twin Towers were leased to 97% occupancy before 9/11. None of the other sites proposed for office development has remotely equal transportation access. With the reconstruction of the subway and PATH stations, plus an additional $4.5 billion in transit improvements planned, such as the new Fulton Transit Center and the direct ""Train-to-the-Plane"" Long Island Rail Road connection, the site becomes even more the logical locus of office development. And New York will need the space. Before 9/11, the Group of 35, a task force of civic leaders led by Sen. Charles Schumer and former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, concluded that the city would need an additional 60 million square feet of new office space by 2020 to accommodate the anticipated addition of 300,000 new jobs. The loss of the Twin Towers only heightens the need. As for those who say that 10 million square feet of office space downtown cannot be absorbed by the real estate market, I would simply point out that history shows them wrong. New York now has about 400 million square feet of office space. All new construction underway already is substantially leased up. New York had 48 million square feet of vacant office space at the beginning of the recession in 1990. By 1998, this space had been absorbed, at an annual rate of about 6 million square feet. We are seeking to rebuild 10 million square feet on the Trade Center site over a period of about 10 years, with the first buildings not coming on line until 2008 and the project reaching completion in 2012. This is an annual absorption rate of about a million feet, much lower than the 1990s' rate. Those who argue that New York cannot reabsorb office space that it previously had are saying that the city has had its day and is entering an extended period of stagnation and decline. I will not accept this view, nor will most New Yorkers. Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in a recent interview with the New York Times that the city ""has to do two things: memorialize, but also build for the future."" I believe that the Twin Towers site can gracefully accommodate -- and that downtown requires -- office and retail space of architectural significance, a dignified memorial that both witnesses and recalls what happened, and cultural amenities that would benefit workers as well as residents of the area. The challenge to accomplish this is enormous. But our city is up to the task.

In the ftoc that's fine, but in the sequences window, it isn't needed. unseen already has a different foreground there (no problem with that), it doesn't need a different background as well.

A method to get messages in & out of sequences comes first, how it displays is a secondary consideration.

Experiment and let me know what works for you. Done some of that. First, the most significant change came from changing relief from raised to sunken. I don't know why, but it just looks better (for me anyway). But even with that, cur and unseen are still just a bit too similar. I ended up using *sequence_cur: -background {PaleGoldenrod} -relief sunken -borderwidth 2 The unnecessary braces are just because some of the colours I was using had spaces in their names.

"""Mr. FoRK"" <fork_list@hotmail.com>",Senate Committee Passes Nanotech Bill,"Weird... I never thought the govmint would get into funding this. You know 'weapons of mass destruction'. etc. etc. == http://dc.internet.com/news/article.php/10849_1467121 September 20, 2002 Senate Committee Passes Nanotech Bill By Roy Mark The Senate Commerce Committee unanimously passed on Thursday legislation to promote nanotechnology research and development. Introduced by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act would create the National Nanotechnology Research Program. The bill is co-sponsored by Sen. Joe Lieberman (D-Conn.) and Sen. George Allen (R-Va.). The proposed program would be a coordinated interagency effort that would support long-term nanoscale research and development and promote effective education and training for the next generation of nanotechnology researchers and professionals. ""The unanimous support of the Senate Commerce Committee is a very big step forward for this very small technology,"" Lieberman, who vowed to pushed to full Senate passage before the end of the year, said. ""Nowhere in the world are the wheels of innovation spinning more rapidly than in the realm of nanotechnology. The U.S. certainly possesses the raw resources and talent to lead the world in developing this technology. Our legislation will provide the nation with a long-term focus and sustained commitment, and facilitate new collaborations between government, academia, and industry that will ensure our place at the head of the next wave of innovation."" The bill would place coordination and management of the nanotechnology program under the National Science and Technology Council. It would also create a Presidential National Nanotechnology Advisory Panel and National Nanotechnology Coordination Office, which would provide administrative and technical support for the Advisory Panel and the Council. ""My own judgment is the nanotechnology revolution has the potential to change America on a scale equal to, if not greater than, the computer revolution. I am determined that the United States will not miss, but will mine the opportunities of nanotechnology,"" Wyden said in introducing the bill. ""At present, efforts in the nanotechnology field are strewn across a half-dozen federal agencies. I want America to marshal its various nanotechnology efforts into one driving force to remain the world's leader in this burgeoning field. And I believe federal support is essential to achieving that goal. To study the potential long-term effects of nanotechnology, a new Center for Societal, Ethical, Educational, Legal and Workforce Issues Related to Nanotechnology would also be established. According to Lieberman, the bill closely tracks the recommendations of the National Research Council (NRC), which completed a thorough review of the National Nanotechnology Initiative in June. Those recommendations included establishing an independent advisory panel; emphasizing long-term goals; striking a balance between long-term and short-term research; supporting the development of research facilities, equipment and instrumentation; creating special funding to support research that falls in the breach between agency missions and programs; promoting interdisciplinary research and research groups; facilitating technology transition and outreach to industry; conducting studies on the societal implications of nanotechnology, including those related to ethical, educational, legal and workforce issues; and the development of metrics for measuring progress toward program goals.",0

You've redefined ""promiscuity"" above as ""total"" or ""average"" activity, which seems to rob it of its common meaning: activity above some specific threshold (usually ""one"") or norm, or involving extra or indiscriminate variety. ""Promiscuity"" is thus inherently a description of distributions rather than averages. Consider a population of 3 males and 3 females. Let there be three pairings which result in each person having sex once. Then, let one of the males also have sex with the other two females. Sure, the average number of sex acts and sex partners is equal between the sexes, tautologically. But here more women than men are: - above the single partner threshold - above the overall average 1.67 acts/partners threshold - above the overall median 1.5 acts/partners - above the overall mode 1 acts/partners And here women have a higher mode (2) and median (2) number of partners.

Apparently the angle on this (i.e. selling without guarantee) is that software is not a product which is sold but a service which is licensed - at least that's what I remember reading about how M$ gets away with providing no guarantee in the U.S. If you're feeling rather deep pocketed, you could always try suing M$ to get a court's view on the matter.

Tim Chapman <timc@2ubh.com>,[zzzzteana] That wacky imam,"http://media.guardian.co.uk/broadcast/comment/0,7493,781769,00.html Hamza's horrid - but we must tolerate him Rod Liddle Wednesday August 28, 2002 The Guardian Sheikh Abu Hamza al-Masri, our maddest of mad mullahs and a cartoon bogeyman to scare the kiddies, spent a quiet and contemplative bank holiday playing with his own children in Victoria Park, Hackney. I've often wondered what incendiary Islamic fundamentalist clerics do on statutory public holidays. Head for the beach and maybe swing by B&Q on the way home, I had hoped. I had this beguiling vision of Hamza paddling in the sea, an ice-cream cone in his one good hand, the waves tickling his shins, and the sheikh mentally preparing to fix those pesky shelves in the kitchen for once, instead of planning the extermination of Zionism and America and maybe me and you, too. But B&Q and a day at the seaside is probably beyond Hamza's budget since the Bank of England froze his assets, so Victoria Park had to do. But he sounded happy enough when I spoke to him, with the babble of tiny, cheerful, Islamic proto-warriors in the background. You must know Hamza; he's the imam designed, it would seem, by the Daily Mail's cartoonist Mac. Large metal hook in place of a left hand. One eye covered by a patch, the other a baleful, watchful, milky-white. We don't mock the disabled any more these days, unless it's someone like Hamza whom we don't like; then, if you'll excuse the inapt phraseology, the gloves come off. So Hamza is known (with that vaulting imagination typical of the British right) as ""Captain Hook"", in articles which usually call for his arrest, or extradition to the US, or deportation back home to Egypt or maybe off to Pakistan or Afghanistan, where he fought the Russians for years and thus sustained his disabilities - anywhere, really; just out of here. And if we can't lock him up or chuck him out of the country, maybe we can force him to shut up. Because we don't like Hamza very much. We weren't that fond of him before September 11, but afterwards, in that nervy, paranoid few months when we all thought the sky might fall in, our disapprobation turned into political persecution. And now the Daily Mirror is agitating again for his arrest because they've got hold of secret videos of the man behaving in an even more inflammatory manner, urging warfare on and looting of enemies of Islam. All out of context, and a very long time ago, says the imam, not unduly bothered. But perhaps he should be, because our reputation for broad-mindedness and tolerance towards people like Hamza was thinning even before the Mirror's scoop. Hamza preaches, or preached, at the scary Finsbury Park Mosque - so, earlier this year, the Charity Commissioners banned him from doing so because of his allegedly inflammatory remarks. I didn't know Charity Commissioners were meant to do stuff like that. He has had his passport seized and not returned; his assets have been frozen. He is tailed by the police every now and then, and his access to the media is restricted by internal policing within broadcasting corporations and the press. And this last point is because, we tell ourselves, endlessly - repeating the mantra over and over again, and fervently wishing it to be true - Hamza is not ""representative"" of British Muslims, as if British Muslims were a simple, homogenous thing with a single voice that one could turn to every now and then for explanation. And perhaps succour. The trouble is, in the first month or so after the twin towers attack he was revealed to be rather more ""representative"" than the list of those government-approved Muslim spokesmen who were - uncomfortably, I suspect - dragooned briefly into statements of support for the war against terrorism and a blanket condemnation of the Taliban. An opinion poll commissioned by Radio 4's Today programme revealed that an overwhelming majority of British Muslims were against George Bush's crusade. One in six were, to put it mildly, ambivalent about the attack on the US (the remainder condemned the attack unequivocally). A large majority thought the war against terrorism was a war against Islam. Which is what Hamza said, repeatedly. But it was something that, at the time, we didn't want to hear. Now, if you quiz the man on present policy at home and abroad he comes across - superficially, at least - as someone from the liberal left. No war against Iraq; Britain to become independent of US foreign policy and attempt rapprochement with Arab states; stronger action against Israel; mistrust of global capitalism; redistribution of wealth. Nor is he particularly anti-semitic, so far as I can tell, although I don't suppose he will be holidaying in Eilat this year. In yesterday's Guardian, the chief rabbi expressed a willingness to talk to Hamza and was grateful for the sheikh's message of condolence when a London synagogue was attacked. Which is not to say that Hamza is a peaceable Jeffersonian democrat who has been wilfully misrepresented: he is, without question, rather more inflammatory in private sermons to his own people than he is in public. His ideology is an arid and uncompromising interpretation of Islam: he would be happy, in a truly Islamic society, to stone women to death for adultery, for example. You and I would find many - perhaps most - of his views utterly repellent. And that's the point. Because Hamza is the true test of our apparent desire to be multicultural. Multiculturalism is not, surely, the cheerful appropriation of bits of inoffensive minority cultural behaviour by the ruling hegemony. That is a sort of syncopated monoculturalism. Multiculturalism is, rather, the ability of society to tolerate views that are antithetical to the dominant culture - and maybe learn from them. The FBI has been investigating Hamza, but, of course, has found nothing remotely incriminating. The real reason for his vilification and persecution is simply the pungency of his views. It is often said that we should shut him up or arrest him because his rhetoric increases hostility against the Muslim population generally. This is a perfectly noble argument, but it does not wash. You don't defuse a difficult situation by pretending it doesn't exist. And if British Muslims - maybe a minority, maybe not - feel a growing sense of unease or mystification at the direction of western foreign policy, it is not because they have been led in that direction by Hamza. Shutting the man up, therefore, won't make a difference. It is rather as Louis MacNeice had it: The glass is falling hour by hour, the glass will fall for ever. But if you break the bloody glass, you won't hold up the weather. ------------------------ Yahoo!

I particularly like their addiction to non-addiction. Additionally, the Mindprod treehugger site has some interesting quotes, etc. To my internal ear, nearly all of these 60's based new-age vernacular seem to assume that you are a simple child (of the 60's?) who needs some religion-like couching of ideas to relate and internalize. Very irritating, but taken in small doses it's interesting to compare and contrast with our (my) modern mental models.

John Hall <johnhall@evergo.net>,liberal defnitions,"Depends on how much over spending vs. how much (and what type) over regulation. The biggest problem with over regulation is the costs can be invisible. It also has the ability to single out particular people, while over spending spreads the damage more evenly. Rent control would be an example of a regulation solution that is in general worse than spending tons of money on public housing. As for the definition of a liberal being someone who seeks to impose both, I find no fault in that definition whatsoever. The opinion that EITHER we are spending too much OR we have too much regulation is pretty much anathema to liberal politics. Finally, those who argue that there are private replacements for much government regulation are not saying that a state of nature (no private replacements, no government regulation) is better than government regulation itself.

I hit the same problem, but the other way round, when I first started playing with this - I'd collected spam for a week or two, then mixed it up with randomly selected messages from my mail boxes. course, it instantly picked up on 'received:2001' as a non-ham.

"""hyatt@mozilla"" <rssfeeds@example.com>",Missing the Point,"URL: http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/#85471617 Date: Not supplied A lot of people seem to be missing the point of Phoenix, as evidenced by the responses on Mozilla News[1] and MozillaZine[2]. Let me emphasize something here: if you think Mozilla's current UI is acceptable, then you are clearly not the target audience for Phoenix. Here is a quiz to test whether or not Phoenix is the right browser for you. - The link toolbar is: - critical to my day-to-day use - vital when using Bugzilla! Doesn't everybody use Bugzilla? - link what? - The sidebar is - indispensable since i run at 1600x1200 resolution - not cool enough, since i can't float and dock all my panels and have splitters between all panels and see web page progress for individual HTML panels and check my email entirely from within sidebar and... - a waste of real estate - Form auto-fill - is not useful for me unless I can fill out 20 pages of personal information first - should just happen automatically - Downloads - should take place in a tree view with progress meters in the columns! - should be clearly visible and understandable. - Toolbars should - be dockable to all four corners of the screen, be able to float outside the window, be fully customizable such that I can make my own custom commands, be able to edit existing buttons' commands, be able to create my own toolbars, be able to put toolbars on the same line, and be able to edit the submenus and context menus of items (including the items on the menu bar) and browse my file system and cook me dinner and wash my car and walk my dog and do my taxes and mow my lawn and... - be customizable within reason - Composer should - always come with my browser. I want composer options all over my UI. Everywhere! - not be part of a Web browser. - Mail should - be part of my browser program. Aren't they the same app? There is a difference? - be a separate application. Now to those people who want the full-blown functionality of the Mozilla trunk, you can still get that with Phoenix. The idea is to relegate more features to the ""optional add-on"" category. If you want the link toolbar or the sidebar or mouse gestures or any other features, you can download and install them yourself. I expect Phoenix will have a little add-in manager that will facilitate this process. There is currently an expectation on the part of an alarming number of people that every feature implemented by anyone should automatically be part of the default Mozilla install/download. Why? A layered approach scales better. You can then have a browser that can become as complex as you want to make it, but the choice is left in your hands. The geek features aren't inflicted on you by default. Finally, remember that Phoenix's UI is not controlled by Netscape. This is an opportunity for some of the core Mozilla Navigator developers to build the browser that they have always wanted to build, without having to compromise the user interface to satisfy the various conflicting pressures exerted by factions within Netscape.

Have done exactly this with debian, only I used a PCMCIA network card and did it off ftp.esat.net (ucd bandwidth is rather good). However, if you've another machine, look into this null modem cable jobby: http://rosebud.sps.queensu.ca/~edd/t100cs.html whether you can connect that to direct cable connectionI've no idea. You could however, put the files onto windows, boot onto a ILUG BBC[tm] and mount the fat32 partition. Easier/Quicker way is to get your hands on a PCMCIA nic.

"""R. A. Hettinga"" <rah@shipwright.com>",Re: [VoID] a new low on the personals tip...,"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA1 I know it's not the popular choice for a lot of people, but I'd suggest, um, church. :-). Like Woody Allen said, 90% of life is showing up, right? Almost anyone can find a church where the sermons don't make you bust out laughing, and you're set. I, for instance, am a Unitarian, which, as someone once observed, is merely a decompression chamber between a real church and a golf course. (ObUUJokes: Mid 70's bumper-sticker: ""Honk if you're not sure""; Lenny Bruce: ""Did you hear about how the Klan burned a question mark on the Unitarian's lawn?""; ""Unitarians would rather go to a discussion group about heaven than to heaven itself.""; ""Unitarians pray 'to whom it may concern'""; etc...) But, seriously, folks, my teenage-adopted denomination (I'm, um, lapsed, on several fronts, a Dutch-Reformed-turned-atheist father and an agnostic mother who used to be a southern Baptist of some stripe or another) and frankly limousine liberal secular-humanist congregation is about as orthogonal to my present congenital-Republican small-l libertarian turned anarchocapitalist politics as it is possible to be (except for the secular-humanist bit...), and I still go pretty regularly, though not as much as I used to. Heck, the older I get the less of the divine I believe in. I'm asymptotically approaching my father's atheism, these days, and I show up at least once a month. Nice folks though, when I can keep a civil tongue in my head -- smart too, when I can't and end up arguing with them. :-). Anyway, if *I* can end up hitched, anyone can. Talk about orthogonal. I met my practically-socialist state-education-bureaucrat wife one year after I started, moved in with her 6 weeks later :-), married her 2 years after that, and I wasn't even trying meet women. I was just looking to make friends as I was new in town. The trick to the church thing is, whatever denomination/congregation you end up in, expect to end up with a mate, not a date. I mean, some guys manage to stay single, but most, like me, don't. You can practically see the laser-sights light up when you walk into a room... That's because, of course, most churches are *run* by women. Most regular attendants are women. Hell, 65% of all new *ministers*, in protestant denominations, at least, are women. No matter your age, looks, intelligence, whatever, you'll end up surrounded by women. You'll be outnumbered, even several to one -- some of whom are at least better looking than you are. :-). The only place where there are *more* women running things is in grass-roots Republican politics - -- but I won't go there, I promise. If I may make a presumption here, since you brought it up, I figure that between the sophistication and diversity of the subcontinent's religions, and the ubiquity of Indians in various stages of assimilation in So/NoCal, you can find some place to hang out near you, Rohit. You probably don't even have to go, um, native, like I did -- backsliding on my own ostensibly rational godless upbringing and becoming, horrors, a Unitarian...

We may come up | with 8 lines that work for everyone, or perhaps introduce yet another | setting that lets folks choose between a few useful models. Of course, | that's an admission of policy failure, but I'm willing to do that. I actually think you're looking in the wrong place. I, at least, have almost no problems with the choice of what gets pasted, or selected, that stuff (for me, if perhaps not users of some gnome variant, which appraently has been fixed anyway) all seems to work just fine. The problem is that a button 1 click clears the selection (PRIMARY) where it shouldn't - the previous selection should only be cleared when there's something else to replace it (even if the highlighting of what is selected is removed). Try this in any other ramdom application (from xterm to netscape) and see how it works. There normally is *no* (mouse based) way to actually clear the primary selection (that is, set it to be a null string). Then, because of the ""if I get asked for the selection value, I will find something"" behaviour, if you click (intending to set the insert point, the way most other GUI's operate), and then paste, because the PRIMARY is clear, but exmh still owns the selection, because nothing else has taken it, it does and finds some other ramdom stuff, from either the clipboard or cut buffer, which tends to be something that was deleted back in the ancient past, and pastes that. That behaviour, to me anyway, is the real issue. Once that gets fixed, we can switch back to operating the normal ""select stuff, click at new insert point, paste"" mode of operation that almost everyone expects to work (whether the ""select stuff"" is somewhere in one of the exmh windows, or elsewhere). kre ps: this message is from my experience as a exmh user only, I've never really understood enough about X and selections to go gazing at that part of the code and see how it all really operates. _______________________________________________ Exmh-users mailing list Exmh-users@redhat.com https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-users",0

Pg 177: In another country, a local newspaper, intrigued by our evidence of extralegal real estate holdings, checked to see if the head of state's official residence had a recorded title. It did not. Pg 92: The value of land in the formal sector of Lima averages US$50 per square meter, whereas in the area of Gamarra, where a great deal of Peru's informal manufacturing sector resides, the value per square meter can go as high as US$3,000. ========== I'd have made the same assumption you did.

French historian Fernand Braudel (so Braudel's Bell Jar, not De Soto's) ==> The key problem is to find out why that sector of society of the past, which I would not hesitate to call capitalist, should have lived as if in a bell jar, cut off from the rest; why was it not able to expand and conquer the whole of society? ... [Why was it that] a significant rate of capital formation was possible only in certain sectors and not in the whole market economy of the time? ... It would perhaps be teasingly paradoxial to say that whatever was in short supply, money certainly was not ... so this was an age where poor land was bought up and magnificent country residents built ... [How do we] resolve the contradiction ... between the depressed economic climate and the splendors of Florence under Lorenzo the Magnificent? -------------- De Soto's theory is that the Bell Jar is formed when you segregate those who have *practical* access to legal property rights and those who do not. The poor[1] have property -- lots and lots of property. What they don't have is access to the systems where we turn property into capital and allow it to start growing. Their property can only be exchanged with a small section of people who know them personally.

One thing that's wrong is who some of us choose as babysitters. Too many kids are put in front of the television for hours each day, to be influenced by what the media and government thinks is important. I learned a long time ago that what they think is important and what is are two different things. I threw the TV out when Xi was 9. She's got her own place now, and still doesn't have one. YaY! Another thing that's wrong is what goes on in public schools. Some allow a bit of individuality, but only for a class or a short period of time, depending on the teachers, most of the time. I dunno how many times I've seen Xi come home from school absolutely miserable or outraged about something that happened at school. She made it to college, though, whew. It's a big problem to tackle, and I don't know the answer. I like the idea of the voucher system, because in a way it is a way parents can vote more efficiently for how their kids are taught. > > > > At least from the viewpoint of demographics sustainability and > > > counterpressure to gerontocracy and resulting innovatiophobia we're doing > > > something wrong. > > > > > > Maybe we should really go dirty Tleilaxu all the way. > > > > > > > Maybe y'all should buy m-w some more bandwidth. > > m-w? > merriam-webster.

I > think it involves calculus to integrate the amount of mass as the column of > the atmosphere trails off. Chemistry types have a method for dealing with this question without dragging in the calculus: Suppose an atmosphere to be mainly affected by gravity, resulting in the potential energy for a mass M to be linear in height h: Mgh. What relative concentrations will we have when two different packets of air are in equilibrium? If they are at the same height, we will have half the mass in one, and half the mass in the other, and the amount flowing from one to the other balances the amount flowing in the opposite direction.[0] If they are at differing heights, then a greater percentage of the higher air tends to descend than that percentage of the lower air which ascends. In order for the two flows to balance, the higher packet must contain less air than the lower, and the mass balance of the flows corresponds thusly: high percentage of thin air --------------------------- low percentage of dense air Now, rates are exponential in energy differences[1], so that theoretically we should expect an exponential decay in height, to compensate. How does it go in practice? -Dave [0] How well does it balance? Chemical equilibria seem stable, as they deal with very large numbers over a very long time. Economic equilibria are viewed from the mayfly standpoint of individual people, and so, at best, the shot noise is very visible. [1] That is to say, rates will be exponential in the free energy differences between endpoints and a transition state. We can ignore that complication in this model.",0

gward@python.net,[Spambayes] python.org email harvesting ready to roll,"[followups to spambayes@python.org please, unless you're specifically concerned about some particular bit of email policy for python.org] OK, after much fiddling with and tweaking of /etc/exim/exim4.conf and /etc/exim/local_scan.py on mail.python.org, I am fairly confident that I can start harvesting all incoming email at a moment's notice. For the record, here's how it all works: * exim4.conf works almost exactly the same as before if the file /etc/exim/harvest does not exist. That is, any ""junk mail condition"" that can be detected by Exim ACLs (access control lists) is handled entirely in exim4.conf: the message is rejected before it ever gets to local_scan.py. This covers such diverse cases as ""message from known spammer"" (reject after every RCPT TO command), ""no message-id header"", and ""8-bit chars in subject"" (both rejected after the message headers/body are read). The main things I have changed in the absence of /etc/exim/harvest are: - don't check for 8-bit chars in ""From"" header -- the vast majority of hits for this test were bounces from some Asian ISP; the remaining hits should be handled by SpamAssassin - do header sender verification (ie. ensure that there's a verifiable email address in at least one of ""From"", ""Reply-to"", and ""Sender"") as late as possible, because it requires DNS lookups which can be slow (and can also make messages that should have been rejected merely be deferred, if those DNS lookups timeout) * if /etc/exim/harvest exists, then the behaviour of all of those ACLs in exim4.conf suddenly changes: instead of rejecting recipients or messages, they add an X-reject header to the message. This header is purely for internal use; it records the name of the folder to which the rejected message should be saved, and also gives the SMTP error message which should ultimately be used to reject the message. Thus, those messages will now be seen by local_scan.py, which now looks for the X-reject header. If found, it uses the folder name specified there to save the message, and then rejects it with the SMTP error message also given in X-reject. (Currently X-reject is retained in saved messages.) If a message was not tagged with X-reject, then local_scan.py runs the usual virus and spam checks. (Namely, my homebrew scan for attachments with filenames that look like Windows executables, and a run through SpamAssassin.) The logic is basically this: if virus: folder = ""virus"" else: run through SpamAssassin if score >= 10.0: folder = ""rejected-spam"" elif score >= 5.0: folder = ""caught-spam"" Finally, local_scan.py writes the message to the designated folder. By far the biggest folder will be ""accepted"" -- the server handles 2000-5000 incoming messages per day, of which maybe 100-500 are junk mail. (Oops, just realized I haven't written the code that actually saves the message -- d'ohh! Also haven't written anything to discriminate personal email, which I must do. Sigh.) * finally, the big catch: waiting until after you've read the message headers and body to actually reject the message is problematic, because certain broken MTAs (including those used by some spammers) don't consider a 5xx after DATA as a permanent error, but keep retrying. D'ohh. This is a minor annoyance currently, where a fair amount of stuff is rejected at RCPT TO time. But in harvest mode, *everything* (with the exception of people probing for open relays) will be rejected at DATA time. So I have cooked up something called the ASBL, or automated sender blacklist. This is just a Berkeley DB file that maps (sender_ip, sender_address) to an expiry time. When local_scan() rejects a message from (sender_ip, sender_address) -- for whatever reason, including finding an X-reject header added by an ACL in exim4.conf -- it adds a record to the ASBL, with an expiry time 3 hours in the future. Meanwhile, there's an ACL in exim4.conf that checks for records in the ASBL; if there's a record for the current (sender_ip, sender_address) that hasn't expired yet, we reject all recipients without ever looking at the message headers or body. The downside of this from the point-of-view of corpus collection is that if some jerk is busily spamming *@python.org, one SMTP connection per address, we will most likely only get one copy. This is a win if you're just thinking about reducing server load and bandwidth, but I'm not sure if it's helpful for training spam detectors. Tim?

Brent Welch <welch@panasas.com>,Re: New Sequences Window,"Well, I've used the check-the-modify-time cache trick for files in many places (not just exmh) so some part of me certainly thinks it is effective. However, it occurred to me that if we do checkpoint state, then aren't we modifying the sequences file for the current folder on every message read? Perhaps we look at the sequences file more than once per message view? Just idle speculation - we can stick in some time calls to find out how expensive things are. Someone asked about increasing the time resolution in the exmh log. We could make that conditional on some support available in 8.3 - Tcl has had ""clock seconds"" (like gettimeofday) and ""clock clicks"" (high resolution timer) for some time. But in 8.3 we've calibrated clock clicks values to microseconds. It is still only useful for relative times, but each call to Exmh_Log could emit the microsecond delta since the last log record. Of course, we are measuring all the overhead of taking the log record, etc. I'll try it out. >>>Chris Garrigues said: > > From: Brent Welch <welch@panasas.com> > > Date: Wed, 28 Aug 2002 10:32:42 -0700 > > > > > > >>>Robert Elz said: > > > Mh_Sequence also goes and rereads the files (.mh_sequences and the > > > context file) but I'm not sure how frequently that one is called. > > > > In some places I maintain caches of files by checking their modify > time, > > but the sequence files are soo small that by the time you stat them to > > check their date stamp, you could just read them again. > > Do you really think this is true?

"""Adam L. Beberg"" <beberg@mithral.com>",EPA Stunned: Diesel Exhaust Can Cause Cancer,"Glad they finally figured this one out... Note the very careful wording, so exhaust may be beneficial to ones health as long as you have a glass a day with some cheese. Interesting timing, since 16,000 truckers just lost their jobs and dont have to worry about death from this anymore. - Adam L. ""Duncan"" Beberg http://www.mithral.com/~beberg/ beberg@mithral.com -------- EPA: Diesel Exhaust Can Cause Cancer Wed Sep 4, 3:29 AM ET By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer WASHINGTON (AP) - Inhaling diesel exhausts from large trucks and other sources over time can cause cancer in humans, an Environmental Protection Agency ( news - web sites) report concludes after a decade of study. The EPA finding, released Tuesday, is expected to buttress the government's push to reduce truck tailpipe emissions by requiring cleaner-burning engines and diesel fuel with ultra-low sulfur content. While acknowledging uncertainties about the long-term health effects of exposure to diesel exhausts, the EPA report said studies involving both animal tests and occupational exposure suggest strong evidence of a cancer risk to humans. ""It is reasonable to presume that the hazard extends to environmental exposure levels"" as well, the report said. ""The potential human health effects of diesel exhausts is persuasive, even though assumptions and uncertainties are involved."" The report mirrors conclusions made previously in documents from various world health agencies and studies in California and is particularly significant because the EPA is the federal agency that regulates diesel emissions under the Clean Air Act. Some environmentalists have raised concerns recently that the Bush administration might try to back away from a Clinton-era regulation that would establish tougher requirements on emissions from large trucks and a separate rule that virtually would eliminate sulfur from diesel fuel. EPA Administrator Christie Whitman repeatedly has promised to go ahead with the tougher truck and diesel rules. Last month, with White House approval, the EPA rebuffed attempts by some diesel engine manufacturers to postpone the requirements, approving new penalties against manufacturers who fail to meet an October deadline for making cleaner-burning truck engines. The engine rule does not affect emissions from trucks already on the road, although the separate regulation cutting the amount of sulfur in diesel fuel is expected to produce pollution reductions. The EPA's 651-page diesel health assessment did not attempt to estimate the probability of an individual getting cancer, given certain exposure to diesel exhaust. Such a risk assessment is commonly made by the EPA when gauging pollution health concerns. But in this case, the report said, ""the exposure-response data are considered too uncertain"" to produce a confident quantitative estimate of cancer risk to an individual. Nevertheless, said the report, the ""totality of evidence from human, animal and other supporting studies"" suggests that diesel exhaust ""is likely to be carcinogenic to humans by inhalation, and that this hazard applies to environmental exposure."" The report reiterated that environmental exposure to diesel exhausts poses short-term health problems and in the long term has been shown to be a ""chronic respiratory hazard to humans"" contributing to increased asthma and other respiratory problems. In some urban areas diesel exhausts account for as much as a quarter of the airborne microscopic soot, the report said. Environmentalists welcomed the study as clear evidence that pollution needs to be curtailed not only from large trucks but also from off-road diesel-powered vehicles. EPA spokeswoman Steffanie Bell said the agency expects to publish a rule early next year dealing with those diesel exhaust sources, which include farm tractors and construction equipment. Emily Figdor of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a private environmental organization, said: ""To reduce the public's exposure to harmful diesel emissions, the Bush administration should ... fully implement clean air standards for diesel trucks and buses and should pass equivalent standards for diesel construction and farm equipment."" Allen Schaeffer, executive director of the industry group Diesel Technology Forum, said the EPA's report ""focused on the past,"" whereas ""the future is clean diesel. Diesel trucks and buses built today are more than eight times cleaner than just a dozen years ago."" The report acknowledged that its findings were based on emissions levels in the mid-1990s, but said the results continued to be valid because the slow turnover of truck engines has kept many of these vehicles on the road.",0

Paul Linehan <plinehan@yahoo.com>,Re: [ILUG] Interesting article on free software licences,"I have translated the article in full - see end of post (I think that I've done a far better job than the Google translation - at least it's readable now - any corrections appreciated). Stuff in {}'s is my (and others) additions to the debate. My apologies if I've paraphrased anybody incorrectly, I will be glad to retract if anyone is miffed. The article makes four main points. 1) Absence of critical clauses. In this case, the idea is that the licence is invalid because it doesn't specify under what country's law the GPL is governed. 2) Specification in English only. That for the end user (as opposed to businesses), the GPL doesn't apply because it's not written in French. 3) Arbitary licence change. The point here is that (under French law) the author can change the terms of the licence arbitarily. This is because any granting of rights by an author must be clearly delimited in terms of how long, where, to whom, dates and times. In the absence of such limitations, the original author has the right to change his software back to closed on a whim. { David Neary makes the point that the copyright holder automatically retains the right to change the licence. Scott replies it simply requires authorisation from all *copyright holders* That's not my understanding. French law allows a GPL type licence *_on condition_* that the specific conditions of the granting of such rights are clear - if they are not, there is nothing to stop the original author taking back ""his work"". The lawyers see this (correctly IMHO) as a weakness in the GPL). } 4) Hidden defects. Roughly, this clause means that the author(s) is/are liable for any defects if the consumer is not an IT engineer, so if Linux blows up and data is lost, then the authors are liable. { Ciaran Johnson says that M$oft and others have similar clauses - the point here is that they are *_all_* invalid - just that this one affects the GPL also. Niall O'Broinn makes the point that it is not a sale, but rather a service/leasing arrangement and that's why it doesn't come under this point. I would suggest that the whole thrust of this article has been to see software ""sales"" (even if no money changes hands) as governed very much by consumer law (in France anyway). Rick Moen makes the point that it is not a sale but rather a granting of rights which are not default. See the bit about even the granting of rights by an author having to be explicitly specified - under French law. The fact that two IP lawyers in France think that the GPL is covered as a sale make me feel that there is a de facto sale and a de facto contract. } 5) Roughly. There may be other reasons under French law why the GPL may be invalid. ----- Whole Article. ----------- Freedom(a) is worth more than these imperfect licences. Specialised lawyers look at the GPL. Lawyer Cyril Rojinsky (duly appointed to the court) and the jurist Vincent Grynbaum, both specialised in the area of intellectual property examine the ""free"" licences and in particular the GPL. They have published their study in the review ""Proprietes intellectuelles (Intellectual property)[1]"" and their conclusion is grim. Their approach is interesting. The problem for them is not to know whether freedom is valid under French law (for them the question is a moot point) but rather they asked themselves about the form and the content of the text of free licences, and in particular the GPL. The problem is not free programmes, but rather the licence contracts of free programmes. Absence of critical clauses. The authors tell us that first of all, the reference to ""copyright"" is not legally sufficient in the framework of international contracts (which is the case of licence contracts for programmes developed and spread via the Internet). The idea of copyright can basically include differences from one country to another. This is why, under international contracts, it is necessary to specify to which laws one is referring (French law, American &c.). The authors only found three public licences which were correctly formulated on this point: QPL, IBM Public Licence and the Mozilla Public Licence). Specification in the English language. Next, the authors remind us that (at least in France), no clause in a contract may be contrary to French law [2]. However, it turns out that a licence such as the GPL is contrary to French law in several respects. Firstly, it is written in English and the FSF doesn't officially approve translations. The ""Toubon law"" obliges this sort of contract to be written in French, including for businesses since the notion of ""user"" applies not only to consumers, but also to businesses, professionals &c. Contacted by the editors of LinuxFrench, lawyer Cyril Rojinsky declared that, as far as business is concerned, the ""Toubon law"" is probably doomed to change since it is in contradiction of European directives on the subject, but whatever about that, the problem is still valid for individuals, and while waiting for it (French law) to change, French companies have to deal with it, since it is the law of the land. A programme under the GPL can suddenly change licence. Another problem, much more serious, is that according to French law, the author of a free programme can, at any time, invoke the invalidity of the licence for this software by simply changing the licence. In effect, the law of intellectual property stipulates that the granting of rights by the author is subordinate to the condition that each of these granted rights be the object of a distinct clause in the granting act (i.e. the licence) and that the granting of any such rights be delimited with respect to its scope and its grantees, and also with respect to its location (i.e. where such rights may be excersised) and duration of any such grants. [3] This is not the case of the GPL nor of other free licences. Briefly, this means that in France, or elsewhere if the author is French, that which is under the GPL could revert to proprietary from one day to the next. The problem of the guarantee ""hidden defects"". An other very serious flaw is that of the guarantee. The GPL licences and others show that the software is delivered ""without guarantee"". You are going to immediately reply that commercical programmes carry the same clause in their licence contracts, and this is correct. However, whatever is written in a licence contract, one cannot free oneself from the ""guarantee from hidden defects"", since it is imposed in the Civil Code. This concept is poorly understood by the layman, it protects the buyer (whoever it may be, individual or business, since it specifies the Civil Code and not consumer protection law) against hidden defects, deliberate or made in good faith by the seller. For example, if one buys a pair of socks in a sale, and the shop has a notice specifying that ""Sale items are neither refunded nor exchanged"", and on arriving home you notice that one of the socks has a hole in it, several scenarios are possible. You could have checked the socks before purchase: the flaw is deemed ""obvious"" and you can sing for your money. You couldn't check the socks (they were packaged for example), and in this case, despite the notice ""neither refund nor exchange"", you may invoke ""hidden defect"" and have them changed or obtain a refund, it's up to you. Personally, I have already invoked in shops the ""hidden defect"" clause and it always worked well (shopkeepers are always very cooperative if you quote a couple of words of the Civil Code). The concept of hidden defect is rather wide, it is necessary that you hadn't the possibility of discovering the defect before buying the product and then (according to the Civil Code) that you wouldn't have bought it at that price if you had known about the defect. The third case which is much rarer , is if you are able to show that the vendor had knowledge of the defect (hidden), but didn't inform you. In this case, not only does he have to reimburse the product, but all expenses incurred by the sale (metro tickets to go to the shop, the fuse which blew when you plugged it in &c.) This idea of ""hidden defect"" applies to all products, including programmes. This was made abundantly clear by the authorities (and the courts) surrounding Y2K. This is particularly inconvenient for free programmes, since a site which offers a Linux distro for download is supposed to provide a guarantee against hidden flaws. LinuxFrench asked Cyril ROJINSKY if in the case of a free programme, one could speak about a ""hidden"" defect since the source code was available, he replied ""Actually, concerning the guarantee, the question of obvious defect will arise. This analyis will be different depending on whether the person who downloads the distribution is an IT professional or not"". OpenSource has this advantage over the proprietary programme: it protects the distributor against a guarantee of hidden defect insofar as the buy is an IT person. But, for distribution to the public at large, the problem remains the same. Roughly Speaking. Lawyer Cyril ROJINSKY said it himself, this study is far from being exhaustive and many other areas could be explored. During this interview, we asked ourselves, for example, about the fragility of the GPL clause which forbids linking source code under the GPL with proprietary code. In effect, the laws of intellectual property give the right to the user to modify a programme with the intention of permitting interoperability with another programme. If for that, I need to link with a proprietary library (communication protocol, device driver) I may consider as ""null and void"" this clause of the GPL. The conclusion of this study is a wake up call for the community. ""Freedom"" merits more than these shoddy licences, which should be modified before court cases over them proliferate and put at risk the undeniable originality of this effort. --------------------------- [1] Une publication de l'Institut de recherche en propriété intellectuelle, No4 Juillet 2002 [2] Une telle clause de contrat qui est opposée à ce que dit la Loi française est qualifiée en terme juridique de « clause réputée non-écrite », c'est-à-dire qu'on fait comme si cette clause n'était pas écrite dans le contrat.

This is remarkable for its lack of newsworthiness. 1) Bletchley Park used optical sensors, which were (and still are) the best way to read paper tape at high speed. You can read about it in the standard accounts, e.g. http://www.picotech.com/applications/colossus.html 2) For decades before that, codebreakers were using optical computing in the form of superposed masks to find patterns. You can read about it in Kahn. 3) People have been doing opto-electronic computing for decades. There's a lot more to it than just holography.

Shouting down a public speaker could be considered a form of censorship. If shouting down public speakers is 'protected' it is only a matter of time before the people doing the shouting have their tactic used against them -every single time they open their mouth-. The tactic is stupid and non-productive and if generally used, will only result in chaos. The tactic is just stupid ego-bation at best, unless the goal is to generate chaos. And humans whose goals and actions in life are to create chaos in society should be locked up (provided you can accurately identify them, which is not really possible anyway, but hey, this is my rant :-).

It is first recorded as being used by Captain > Frederick Marryat in /Jacob Faithful/ in 1835: ""I won't thrash you Tom. > Shiver my timbers if I do"". It seems implausible to me that ""shiver"" here means ""to shake""; I don't recall seeing the word used transitively in that sense, and web1913 lists that sense as ""v. i."", or intransitive. The transitive sense of ""shiver"", which we no longer use but which people used widely in the 1800s (web1913 doesn't even list it as archaic or obsolete), means ""to shatter into splinters, normally with a blow"". Shivering a boat's timbers, of course, leaves you with no boat. (Shivering some of them, which will happen if you hit a rock hard enough, leaves you with a sinking boat.) So, ""Shiver my timbers if I do,"" can be reasonably interpreted as a more vivid way of saying, ""May I die suddenly if I do."" The interpretation suggested by Quinion, ""May my boat be damaged,"" neither makes as much sense in context nor obeys the normal rules of grammar. I've sent a copy of this to Quinion.",0

But here's the raw bits for all to peruse and check out what's really going on... Best, Rohit =========================================================== DataPower delivers XML acceleration device By Scott Tyler Shafer August 27, 2002 5:46 am PT DATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed specifically to process XML data. Unlike competing solutions that process XML data in software, DataPower's device processes the data in hardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance, according to company officials. The new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the first in a family of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based startup. The DataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology called XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML data. According to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future proliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data between two businesses. ""Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure,"" Kelly said. ""The XA35 is the first of a family."" Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up to 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on application servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best alternative. In addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount importance in the world of XML. ""Today's firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,"" Kelly said. ""A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. Firewalls are blind to XML today."" Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on security, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said. According to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the company itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed and security. After trying the software path, the company turned to creating a solution that would process XML in hardware. ""Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,"" said Kelly, adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. Kelly said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with technologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that he believes will be mostly false. Other content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet, while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytes and thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained. The 1U-high network device has been tested against a large collection of XML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language as they pass through the device. The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify and process those packets that are XML, Kelly said. In addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an application co-processor. This deployment method gives administrators more granular control over what data is inspected and the application server itself controls the device. DataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging market. Startup Sarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega XPE switch in May, and earlier this month Tarari, an Intel spin-off, launched with a focus on content processing and acceleration. The DataPower device is now available, priced starting at $54,995. The company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in field trails at a number of other enterprises. ======================================================================== = DataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was founded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov, a technology visionary who foresaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols would have on enterprise networks. Long before industry interest in XML grew, Kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class M.I.T. engineers and designed the industry's first solutions to address the unique requirements for processing XML. The first such solution was a software interpreter called DGXT. This software-based approach to XML processing is still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today. Leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from developing software-based accelerators, Kuznetsov's team raised the bar and designed a system for processing XML in purpose-built hardware. In 2001, DataPower's effort produced XML Generation Three (XG3™), the industry's fastest technology for XML processing, bar none. Today, XG3™ technology powers the industry's first wire-speed XML network devices, enabling secure, high-speed applications and XML Web Services. While other companies are just now marketing first versions of products, DataPower is delivering its third generation of technology, providing an immediate return on technology investments to industry-leading customers and partners. DataPower's M.I.T. heritage is complemented by a management team that brings decades of experience in the networking and computing industries, drawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including Akamai, Argon, Cascade, Castle Networks, Sycamore and Wellfleet. ======================================================================== = DataPower Technology Secures $9.5 Million in Funding Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed Capital Back Pioneer in XML-Aware Networking for Web Services CAMBRIDGE, Mass. - July 8, 2002 - DataPower Technology, Inc., the leading provider of XML-Aware network infrastructure, today announced that it has secured $9.5 million in series B financing. Investors for this round include Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed Capital Partners. Michael Tyrrell, of Venrock, Bill Burnham, of Mobius, and Jeff Fagnan, of Seed Capital, have joined DataPower’s Board of Directors. DataPower will use this funding to accelerate development, marketing and sales of the company’s breakthrough technology for XML-Aware networking. Founded in 1999, DataPower invented the world’s first intelligent XML networking devices, capable of transforming XML traffic and transactions at the wire-speed enterprises need to effectively embrace Web services and other XML-centric initiatives. DataPower’s solutions are based on its patent-pending XML Generation Three (XG3™) technology. ""Enterprises are adopting XML at rapid rate to facilitate inter-and intra-company communications but their network infrastructure is ill prepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type. DataPower’s XML-acceleration devices enable the wirespeed processing of XML that is required to support next generation enterprise applications,"" said Eugene Kuznetsov, CTO and founder of DataPower Technology. ""DataPower gives companies the ability to use XML that’s critical to Web services projects without sacrificing an ounce of performance."" A single DataPower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of 10 servers—breaking the performance bottleneck associated with XML processing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment. In addition, the DataPower platform provides enhanced XML security, protection against XML-based denial-of-service attacks, connection of e-business protocols for incompatible XML data streams, load balancing between back-end servers and real-time statistics reports. ""In the post-bubble economy, technology investment decisions require laser-focused scrutiny. DataPower’s patent-pending technology addresses a very real and growing pain point for enterprises,"" said Michael Tyrrell of Venrock Associates. ""By turbo-charging their networks with DataPower’s unique XML-Aware networking technology, companies will be free to adopt next generation Web services without encountering performance and security pitfalls."" ""We looked long and hard for a company capable of addressing the rapidly growing problems surrounding XML message processing performance and security,"" said Bill Burnham of Mobius Venture Capital. ""DataPower is on their third generation of technology. Their patent pending XML Generation Three (XG3) technology was quite simply the single most compelling technology solution we have seen to date."" ""XML is not a nice-to-have, it is a must have for enterprises serious about optimizing application efficiency. Since 1999, DataPower has been developing solutions to facilitate enterprise use of XML and Web services,"" said Jeff Fagnan of Seed Capital Partners. ""DataPower’s XML-acceleration devices are a key requirement for enterprises that rely on XML for mission critical applications.""

Also, because of the ability to send high-speed data through the drill pipe, technologies once thought unobtainable � such as collecting seismic data at the drill bit � may now be possible. With high-resolution seismic data collected ""ahead of the bit,"" operators could steer the drill bit more precisely toward oil- and gas-bearing sweet spots and away from less productive areas.

Owen ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- . *Will Canada's ISPs become spies?* By Declan McCullagh <mailto:declan.mccullagh@cnet.com> Staff Writer, CNET News.com August 27, 2002, 12:56 PM PT http://news.com.com/2100-1023-955595.html <http://news.com.com/2100-1023-955595.html?tag=prntfr> *WASHINGTON--The Canadian government is considering a proposal that would force Internet providers to rewire their networks for easy surveillance by police and spy agencies.* A discussion draft <http://www.canada.justice.gc.ca/en/cons/la_al/> released Sunday also contemplates creating a national database of every Canadian with an Internet account, a plan that could sharply curtail the right to be anonymous online. The Canadian government, including the Department of Justice <http://canada.justice.gc.ca/> and Industry Canada <http://www.ic.gc.ca/>, wrote the 21-page blueprint as a near-final step in a process that seeks to give law enforcement agents more authority to conduct electronic surveillance. A proposed law based on the discussion draft is expected to be introduced in Parliament late this year or in early 2003. Arguing that more and more communications take place in electronic form, Canadian officials say such laws are necessary to fight terrorism and combat even run-of-the-mill crimes. They also claim that by enacting these proposals, Canada will be following its obligations under the Council of Europe's cybercrime treaty <http://news.com.com/2100-1001-268894.html>, which the country is in the process of considering. If the discussion draft were to become law, it would outlaw the possession of computer viruses, authorize police to order Internet providers to retain logs of all Web browsing for up to six months, and permit police to obtain a search warrant allowing them to find ""hidden electronic and digital devices"" that a suspect might be concealing. In most circumstances, a court order would be required for government agents to conduct Internet monitoring. Canada and the United States are nonvoting members of the Council of Europe, and representatives from both countries' police agencies have endorsed the controversial cybercrime treaty <http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/CadreListeTraites.htm>, which has drawn protests from human rights activists and civil liberties groups. Of nearly 50 participating nations, only Albania has formally adopted <http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/searchsig.asp?NT=185&CM=8&DF=27/08/02>, or ratified, the treaty. Michael Geist <http://aix1.uottawa.ca/%7Egeist/>, a professor at the University of Ottawa who specializes in e-commerce law, says that the justification for adopting such sweeping changes to Canadian law seems weak. ""It seems to me that the main justification they've given for all the changes is that we want to ratify the cybercrime treaty and we need to make changes,"" Geist said. ""To me that's not a particularly convincing argument. If there are new powers needed for law enforcement authority, make that case."" Geist added that ""there's nothing in the document that indicates (new powers) are needed. I don't know that there have been a significant number of cases where police have run into problems."" Probably the most sweeping change the legal blueprint contemplates is compelling Internet providers and telephone companies to reconfigure their networks to facilitate government eavesdropping and data-retention orders. The United States has a similar requirement, called the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act <http://www.epic.org/privacy/wiretap/calea/calea_law.html>, but it applies only to pre-Internet telecommunications companies. ""It is proposed that all service providers (wireless, wireline and Internet) be required to ensure that their systems have the technical capability to provide lawful access to law enforcement and national security agencies,"" according to the proposal. Companies would be responsible for paying the costs of buying new equipment. Sarah Andrews, an analyst at the Electronic Privacy Information Center <http://www.epic.org/> (EPIC) who specializes in international law, says the proposal goes beyond what the cybercrime treaty specifies. ""Their proposal for intercept capability talks about all service providers, not just Internet providers,"" Andrews said. ""The cybercrime treaty deals only with computer data."" EPIC opposes <http://www.privacyinternational.org/issues/cybercrime/coe/ngo_letter_601.htm> the cybercrime treaty, saying it grants too much power to police and does not adequately respect privacy rights. Another section of the proposal says the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police recommends ""the establishment of a national database"" with personal information about all Canadian Internet users. ""The implementation of such a database would presuppose that service providers are compelled to provide accurate and current information,"" the draft says. Gus Hosein, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics and an activist with Privacy International, calls the database ""a dumb idea."" ""Immediately you have to wonder if you're allowed to use anonymous mobile phones or whether you're allowed to connect to the Internet anonymously,"" Hosein said. A representative for George Radwanski <http://www.privcom.gc.ca/au_e.asp>, Canada's privacy commissioner, said the office is reviewing the blueprint and does not ""have any comments on the paper as it stands."" Comments on the proposal can be sent to la-al@justice.gc.ca <mailto:la-al@justice.gc.ca> no later than Nov. 15.",0

As usual the result is that I've spent much more time repackaging the darn thing than actually testing the functionalities or trying to hear the great sound quality people seem to think it outputs... but hey, some of you will benefit from that, right? ;-) I've got the whole thing working on a Valhalla system, but the packages should easily install or at least recompile on Enigma, Limbo/(null) and maybe others, who knows ;-) Here are quick instructions for those of you that wish to try it out : - Recompile the ""alsa-driver"" source rpm for your running kernel (you can install the binary package if you're using the i686 2.4.18-10) - Install this ""alsa-driver"" package - Install the ""alsa-libs"" package - Install the ""alsa-utils"" package Now go to this URL and find out what you need to change in your /etc/modules.conf file to replace the default OSS driver loading : http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/ (very complete and very good documentation!) Hopefully you'll see that your card *is* supported ;-) Reboot, or remove by hand your current sound modules (you'll probably need to stop many applications to free the sound resource...) ""by hand"" and insert the new ones. If all is well you've got ALSA working! (""dmesg"" to check is a good idea), you now just need to adjust the volume levels with e.g. aumix and alsamixer because everything is muted by default. With ""aplay"" you can already test files to see if you hear anything. You can also install the XMMS plugin (seems to make my XMMS segfault on exit... hmmm, but maybe it's another plugin) to listen to your good ol' mp3 files... that's it! It really isn't complicated, and has never been from what I see. The only thing I disliked was to have to install from source... but as I can't imagine myself doing that ;-) I've repackaged everything cleanly. Even the /dev entries are included in the rpm package (and *not* created by an ugly %post script, I insist!) and seamlessly integrate into the /etc/makedev.d structure. There are also a few other noticeable differences with the default provided ALSA spec files, for example I've split alsa-lib's development files into an alsa-lib-devel package and included static libraries... there are others of course (oh yes, the kernel version against which the ""alsa-driver"" package is compiled gets neatly integrated in the rpm release, so does the architecture!). I'm open to any comments or suggestions about these packages! Download : http://ftp.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/testing/alsa/ Current spec files : http://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-driver/alsa-driver.spec http://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-lib/alsa-lib.spec http://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-utils/alsa-utils.spec (All others, patches etc. : http://freshrpms.net/builds/ ) Matthias PS: As an extra bonus, I've also recompiled xine with alsa support! Simply run ""xine -A alsa09"" and off you go!

Online gaming continues to grow. Screw ""Britannia"", real-life Britain would be a fun world to wander/ conquer/explore virtually, in role-playing or real- time-strategy games. And of course, as James Rogers points out, it's an ideal display substrate for all sorts of other overlaid data. Maps are great, photrealistic 3-D maps of everywhere which can have many other static and dynamic datasets overlaid are spectacular.

kragen@pobox.com,asynchronous I/O (was Re: Gasp!),"Of course we've had select() since BSD 4.2 and poll() since System V or so, and they work reasonably well for asynchronous I/O up to a hundred or so channels, but suck after that; /dev/poll (available in Solaris and Linux) is one approach to solving this; Linux has a way to do essentially the same thing with real-time signals, and has for years; and FreeBSD has kqueue. More details about these are at http://www.citi.umich.edu/projects/linux-scalability/ None of this helps with disk I/O; most programs that need to overlap disk I/O with computation, on either proprietary Unixes or Linux, just use multiple threads or processes to handle the disk I/O. POSIX specifies a mechanism for nonblocking disk I/O that most proprietary Unixes implement. The Linux kernel hackers are currently rewriting Linux's entire I/O subsystem essentially from scratch to work asynchronously, because they can easily build efficient synchronous I/O primitives from asynchronous ones, but not the other way around. So now Linux will support this mechanism too. It probably doesn't need saying for anyone who's read Beberg saying things like ""Memory management is a non-issue for anyone that has any idea at all how the hardware functions,"" but he's totally off-base. People should know by now not to take anything he says seriously, but apparently some don't, so I'll rebut. Not surprisingly, the rebuttal requires many more words than the original stupid errors. In detail, he wrote: > Could it be? After 20 years without this feature UNIX finally > catches up to Windows and has I/O that doesnt [sic] totally suck for > nontrivial apps? No way! Unix acquired nonblocking I/O in the form of select() about 23 years ago, and Solaris has had the particular aio_* calls we are discussing for many years. Very few applications need the aio_* calls --- essentially only high-performance RDBMS servers even benefit from them at all, and most of those have been faking it fine for a while with multiple threads or processes. This just provides a modicum of extra performance. > OK, so they do it with signals or a flag, which is completely > ghetto, but at least they are trying.

UNIX is just > now looking at it's [sic] I/O model and adapting to a multiprocess > multithreaded world so it's gonna be years yet before a posix API > comes out of it. Although I don't have a copy of the spec handy, I think the aio_* APIs come from the POSIX spec IEEE Std 1003.1-1990, section 6.7.9, which is 13 years old, and which I think documented then-current practice. They might be even older than that. Unix has been multiprocess since 1969, and most Unix implementations have supported multithreading for a decade or more. > Bottom line is the ""do stuff when something happens"" model turned > out to be right, and the UNIX ""look for something to do and keep > looking till you find it no matter how many times you have to look"" > is not really working so great anymore. Linux's aio_* routines can notify the process of their completion with a ""signal"", a feature missing in Microsoft Windows; a ""signal"" causes the immediate execution of a ""signal handler"" in a process. By contrast, the Microsoft Windows mechanisms to do similar things (such as completion ports) do not deliver a notification until the process polls them. I don't think signals are a better way to do things in this case (although I haven't written any RDBMSes myself), but you got the technical descriptions of the two operating systems exactly backwards. Most programs that use Linux real-time signals for asynchronous network I/O, in fact, block the signal in question and poll the signal queue in a very Windowsish way, using sigtimedwait() or sigwaitinfo(). -- <kragen@pobox.com> Kragen Sitaker <http://www.pobox.com/~kragen/> Edsger Wybe Dijkstra died in August of 2002.

CSS-vs-tables is the hemorrhoid of the web design world. But I digress.) If you were around back then, you will no doubt recall that I was in the pro-CSS camp[1].

Well, it's crap[2]. There are lots of good arguments for designing with web standards and CSS: automatically print-friendly pages[3], dynamic style switchers[4], reduced bandwidth[5], and aiding and abetting accessibility[6] (a topic which I claim to know a lot about[7]), among others. But &#8220;because it'll future-proof your site for the next generation of mobile devices&#8221; is not one of them.

gkm@petting-zoo.net,Facts about sex.,"Forwarded-by: Flower Did you know that you can tell from the skin whether a person is sexually active or not? 1. Sex is a beauty treatment. Scientific tests find that when woman make love they produce more of the hormone estrogen, which makes hair shiny and skin smooth. 2. Gentle, relaxed lovemaking reduces your chances of suffering dermatitis, skin rashes and blemishes. The sweat produced cleanses the pores and makes your skin glow. 3. Lovemaking can burn up those calories you piled on during that romantic dinner. 4. Sex is one of the safest sports you can take up. It stretches and tones up just about every muscle in the body. It's more enjoyable than swimming 20 laps, and you don't need special sneakers! 5. Sex is an instant cure for mild depression. It releases the body endorphin into the bloodstream, producing a sense of euphoria and leaving you with a feeling of well-being. 6. The more sex you have, the more you will be offered. The sexually active body gives off greater quantities of chemicals called pheromones. These subtle sex perfumes drive the opposite sex crazy! 7. Sex is the safest tranquilizer in the world. IT IS 10 TIMES MORE EFFECTIVE THAN VALIUM. 8. Kissing each day will keep the dentist away. Kissing encourages saliva to wash food from the teeth and lowers the level of the acid that causes decay, preventing plaque build-up. 9. Sex actually relieves headaches. A lovemaking session can release the tension that restricts blood vessels in the brain. 10. A lot of lovemaking can unblock a stuffy nose. Sex is a national antihistamine. It can help combat asthma and hay fever. ENJOY SEX!",0

So here we Dave's attempt to fool you into thinking they're some sort of monsters, violent ones no less. Anyone who works with Hemenway or Kearney should be aware that these people are nothing less than monsters, who will stoop to any level to get their way. Yeah sure Dave, whatever you need to believe. The truth is these folks do a fine job of actually helping others and improving RSS in general.

Expects others to do research for him Abuses anyone who tries to help him Pontificates, incorrectly, about only part of the issue Realizes he's been a fool but refuses to correct himself Plods forward pedantically trying to defend his idiocy Tries making the educated people look like fools. Sends private e-mails to them trying to scare them off. Exposes any private e-mail they write, out of context. Deflects and runs off to some new topic, repeats from #1 His continued diatribes about RSS-1.0 and it's use of RDF reveal this to be true. Dave doesn't get the idea of the semantic web. He'd rather have you follow his stupid ideas than dare admit that the work of others is worth trying. One reader wrote to us with a good analogy. ""It's like that movie The Poseidon Adventure.

I'm going to push back the caveat-removing on the 2.0 spec by 24 hours. Still have work to do on the sample file, I want to look into the RFC for time-date specs, and get started on the Radio implementation of 2.0. I have to prepare for Seybold tomorrow, and I want to a little memorial for 9-11. A busy few days for a guy still recovering. Also, it would be great if people who make content tools could review the 2.0 spec and see if there are any deal-stoppers. Hell yeah there are deal stoppers, like nobody wants it nor will they use it! The poor Radio customers! The poor Salon blog users! They're going to be dragged unwillingly into producing XML content that nobody will use! So with the flip of his mighty upgrade switch Dave is going to turn all their content into totally unsupported garbage!!! Ya better speak up now folks otherwise your content is going to start getting rejected! Of course at the same time Dave tries to play the sympathy card. What utter fucking nonsense. This past weekend, the blogosphere excoriates him for his 'blame America' bullshit. Then the RSS community tells him to get stuffed with his dictator release of RSS. Now he's trying to pretend we should be nice to him because he's still recovering? Uh, Dave, if you want to take a rest from the battle then stop picking fights. We'll still kick your ass regardless. That's what years of your abusing people has gotten you Dave. No sympathy anymore, none whatsoever. 9/11/02; 1:56:10 PM - Discuss Dave is Scary on 9/11 Posted on Scripting News on 9/10/2002: Note: During the day tomorrow there will be no updates to Scripting News. I'll be in SF at Seybold, leading a discussion on Web Services for Publishing with people from Amazon, Apple, Google and Jake Savin of UserLand. I may be able to update my Radio weblog, but only if there's something really important to report. So best wishes for a happy and safe 9-11.

Scripting News is full of examples. So we found it surprising, as did many others, when Luserland software tried to patent the term 'RSS' back in 2000. Here's the patent application: http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&entry=78025336 This was apparently just between the start of the RSS 1.0 development efforts, and the publication of the specification. Winer knew about the RSS 1.0 stuff - indeed, he complained about it bitterly at the time. Could Dave be any more transparent?!?!??!?!!!!!!! Since when has Dave been required to follow anything he says he wants others to do??? A good quote from before he filed the patent application: Tim O'Reilly says patents are OK, he's just against stupid patents.

boingboing <rssfeeds@example.com>,Why is it so hard to get a cab in San Francisco?,"URL: http://boingboing.net/#85519806 Date: Not supplied A San Francisco cabbie -- generally a well-educated and firm-opinion-holding class of person -- has an essay about a subject near and dear to my (non-car-owning) heart: Why is it so damned hard to get a cab in San Francisco? In fact, no cab company ever tells a driver to pick up anyone. When you phone a cab firm in San Francisco, your call is treated not as an order, not as a binding oral contract, but simply as a request... So, why don't cab companies ensure that we pick you up on time-or at all? In a nutshell, labor law states that if a cab company actually commands a driver to carry out a specific action, that constitutes an employer-employee relationship. But if a company farms its work out to independent contractors, it can rid itself of costly expenses such as disability and social security taxes. It also means that the contractor drivers can't unionize.

Alberta, and to a lesser extent some of the other Western provinces, is definitely not happy with the current arrangement. Some of this has to do with the strange way the Canadian government is structured. When I was last up in Alberta (a month ago), the newspapers were reporting something like 70% of Albertans favor separating from Canada, and over several distinct issues. The problem is basically that while Alberta is an economic powerhouse that is propping up the weaker economies of the Eastern provinces, their interests are openly and unapologetically ignored by the government in Ottawa. While Alberta sends something like twice the tax dollars to Ottawa per capita of the average Canadian, they only have token representation in the federal government. While I'm not clear on exactly how the government works up there, representation is not entirely based on population, and it works out that some eastern provinces with populations smaller than the city of Calgary alone have substantially more representatives in the legislature than the entire province of Alberta. The long and the short of it is that the eastern provinces use Alberta as a personal ATM machine for their social programs while not even so much as throwing Alberta a bone, and are able to do so because even the sparsely populated eastern provinces can out-vote Alberta despite having fewer people. Or something like that. The Canadian government is less restricted than the US government, so they can do strange things, like having restrictive regulations that only apply to certain provinces, Alberta being on the receiving end of many such obscenities. It is essentially a much worse version of what is happening in the inter-mountain West of the US. Unlike the US case though, the rest of Canada would really be hurting if they weren't receiving all those tax dollars from Alberta. OTOH, Alberta would probably thrive. I have friends in Alberta, and visit occasionally, but I'm not totally clear on everything that goes on in that country, due to my partial unfamiliarity with how the government works up there, so I'm a little fuzzy on some of the details. What I do know is that on average the Albertans are quite unhappy with their current position in Canada and the sentiment has been getting worse over the years.

Terminal velocity can be calculated by $v_{T} = \sqrt{\frac{2mg}{CpA}}$ where C is an experimentally determined coefficient, p is the density of the air, and A is the area of the object. These calculations only work if the object is blunt and the airflow is turbulent, blah blah blah. Terminal velocity for a skydiver actually varies with how the diver holds themselves -- you go faster if you pull yourself into a cannonball. That is the ""A"", for the most part. All else being equal, the terminal velocity is inversely proportional to the square root of air density. Air density drops off pretty quickly, and I really should be doing something other than digging up the math for that. I think it involves calculus to integrate the amount of mass as the column of the atmosphere trails off. I grabbed the other stuff directly out of a book :).

Soon, the spotlight comes up again. The lead singer grabs the microphone. ""This is Frank Bellknap Long!"" he yells, and, feverish, launches into a lecture on Long's oeuvre. There can't be more than a handful of people on this earth who could get a beer-sodden thrash crowd to listen to an English Lit lecture. Thirty seconds later, the audience is sufficiently educated, and the guys begin to wail. Jake the singer holds the microphone over his head and belts out the song in a growling voice that's monster-movie low. ""No reason! No corners!"" he shouts. Two minutes later, they're done with the pulps and ready to move on to the New Wave. ""Our next song is about Harlan Ellison!"" Jake bellows, and the geeks, the hipsters, the metalheads, and the drunks let out a howl of mutual joy. Bl��dhag -- note the dual umlauts -- hails from Seattle. Describing themselves as ""edu-core,"" the band performs nothing but two-minute thrash tributes to science fiction writers.

All clues with prob MIN_SPAMPROB and MAX_SPAMPROB are saved in min and max lists, and all other clues are fed into the nbest heap. Then the shorter of the min and max lists cancels out the same number of clues in the longer list. Whatever remains of the longer list (if anything) is then fed into the nbest heap too, but no more than MAX_DISCRIMINATORS of them. In no case do more than MAX_DISCRIMINATORS clues enter into the final probability calculation, but all of the min and max lists go into the list of clues (else you'd have no clue that massive cancellation was occurring; and massive cancellation may yet turn out to be a hook to signal that manual review is needed). In your specific case, the excess of clues in the longer MAX_SPAMPROB list pushed everything else out of the nbest heap, and that's why you didn't see anything other than 0.01 and 0.99. Before adding these special lists, the outcome when faced with many 0.01 and 0.99 clues was too often a coin toss: whichever flavor just happened to appear MAX_DISCRIMINATORS//2 + 1 times first determined the final outcome. >> That sure sets the record for longest list of cancelling extreme clues! > This happened to be the longest one, but there were quite a few > similar ones. I just beat it <wink>: a tokenization scheme that folds case, and ignores punctuation, and strips a trailing 's' from words, and saves both word bigrams and word unigrams, turned up a low-probability very long spam with a list of 410 0.01 clues and 125 0.99 clues!

No matter how often it says Zope, it gets only one 0.01 clue from doing so. Ditto for ZEO. In contrast, HTML markup has many unique ""words"" that get 0.99. BTW, this is a clear case where the assumption of conditionally-independent word probabilities is utterly bogus -- e.g., the probability that ""<body>"" appears in a message is highly correlated with the prob of ""<br>"" appearing. By treating them as independent, naive Bayes grossly misjudges the probability that both appear, and the only thing you get in return is something that can actually be computed <wink>. Read the ""What about HTML?"" section in tokenizer.py. From the very start, I've been investigating what would work best for the mailing lists hosted at python.org, and HTML decorations have so far been too strong a clue to justify ignoring it in that specific context. I haven't done anything geared toward personal email, including the case of non-mailing-list email that happens to go through python.org. I'd prefer to strip HTML tags from everything, but last time I tried that it still had bad effects on the error rates in my corpora (the full test results with and without HTML tag stripping is included in the ""What about HTML?"" comment block). But as the comment block also says, # XXX So, if another way is found to slash the f-n rate, the decision here # XXX not to strip HTML from HTML-only msgs should be revisited. and we've since done several things that gave significant f-n rate reductions. I should test that again now. > Are there any minable-but-unmined header lines in your corpus left? Almost all of them -- apart from MIME decorations that appear in both headers and bodies (like Content-Type), the *only* header lines the base tokenizer looks at now are Subject, From, X-Mailer, and Organization. > Or do we have to start with a different corpus before we can make > progress there? I would need different data, yes. My ham is too polluted with Mailman header decorations (which I may or may not be able to clean out, but fudging the data is a Mortal Sin and I haven't changed a byte so far), and my spam too polluted with header clues about the fellow who collected it. In particular I have to skip To and Received headers now, and I suspect they're going to be very valuable in real life (for example, I don't even catch ""undisclosed recipients"" in the To header now!). > ... > No, sorry. These were all of the following structure: > > multipart/mixed > text/plain (brief text plus URL(s)) > text/html (long HTML copied from website) Ah! That explains why the HTML tags didn't get stripped. I'd again offer to add an optional argument to tokenize() so that they'd get stripped here too, but if it gets glossed over a third time that would feel too much like a loss <wink>. >> This seems confused: Jeremy didn't use my trained classifier pickle, >> he trained his own classifier from scratch on his own corpora. >> ... > I think it's still corpus size. I reported on tests I ran with random samples of 220 spams and 220 hams from my corpus (that means training on sets of those sizes as well as predicting on sets of those sizes), and while that did harm the error rates, the error rates I saw were still much better than Jeremy reported when using 500 of each. Ah, a full test run just finished, on the tokenization scheme that folds case, and ignores punctuation, and strips a trailing 's' from words, and saves both word bigrams and word unigrams This is the code: # Tokenize everything in the body. lastw = '' for w in word_re.findall(text): n = len(w) # Make sure this range matches in tokenize_word(). if 3 <= n <= 12: if w[-1] == 's': w = w[:-1] yield w if lastw: yield lastw + w lastw = w + ' ' elif n >= 3: lastw = '' for t in tokenize_word(w): yield t where word_re = re.compile(r""[\w$\-\x80-\xff]+"") This at least doubled the process size over what's done now. It helped the f-n rate significantly, but probably hurt the f-p rate (the f-p rate is too low with only 4000 hams per run to be confident about changes of such small *absolute* magnitude -- 0.025% is a single message in the f-p table): false positive percentages 0.000 0.000 tied 0.000 0.075 lost +(was 0) 0.050 0.125 lost +150.00% 0.025 0.000 won -100.00% 0.075 0.025 won -66.67% 0.000 0.050 lost +(was 0) 0.100 0.175 lost +75.00% 0.050 0.050 tied 0.025 0.050 lost +100.00% 0.025 0.000 won -100.00% 0.050 0.125 lost +150.00% 0.050 0.025 won -50.00% 0.050 0.050 tied 0.000 0.025 lost +(was 0) 0.000 0.025 lost +(was 0) 0.075 0.050 won -33.33% 0.025 0.050 lost +100.00% 0.000 0.000 tied 0.025 0.100 lost +300.00% 0.050 0.150 lost +200.00% won 5 times tied 4 times lost 11 times total unique fp went from 13 to 21 false negative percentages 0.327 0.218 won -33.33% 0.400 0.218 won -45.50% 0.327 0.218 won -33.33% 0.691 0.691 tied 0.545 0.327 won -40.00% 0.291 0.218 won -25.09% 0.218 0.291 lost +33.49% 0.654 0.473 won -27.68% 0.364 0.327 won -10.16% 0.291 0.182 won -37.46% 0.327 0.254 won -22.32% 0.691 0.509 won -26.34% 0.582 0.473 won -18.73% 0.291 0.255 won -12.37% 0.364 0.218 won -40.11% 0.436 0.327 won -25.00% 0.436 0.473 lost +8.49% 0.218 0.218 tied 0.291 0.255 won -12.37% 0.254 0.364 lost +43.31% won 15 times tied 2 times lost 3 times total unique fn went from 106 to 94",0

khare@alumni.caltech.edu,NYTimes.com Article: Texas Pacific Goes Where Others Fear to Spend,"This article from NYTimes.com has been sent to you by khare@alumni.caltech.edu. Texas Pacific, in addition to its multibillion dollar portfolio detailed below, actually does invest in promising new companies, not just turnarounds. It's just that KnowNow is waaay to small of a part of their $7.2B portfolio... so far! Rohit khare@alumni.caltech.edu Texas Pacific Goes Where Others Fear to Spend August 25, 2002 By RIVA D. ATLAS and EDWARD WONG It was one of the first calls David N. Siegel placed when he became chief executive of the beleaguered US Airways last March. Seeking advice on how to hammer out a leaner and meaner business plan, keep his planes flying and renegotiate costly contracts with the unions, he flipped through his files and found the number for the Texas Pacific Group, an investment firm headed by David Bonderman, a former civil rights lawyer with a reputation for fixing problem companies. Mr. Siegel, once a top executive at Continental Airlines, had watched Texas Pacific's partners turn an investment of $66 million in the airline, made three years after it filed for bankruptcy in 1990, into a profit of more than $600 million. And they had made nearly as much on their stake in America West, which filed for bankruptcy in 1992. That search for advice turned into an offer. Why not let Texas Pacific have a role in US Airways' revival? asked Richard Schifter, the Texas Pacific executive whom Mr. Siegel reached. In June, Mr. Siegel called Mr. Schifter again. And days before US Airways announced its plans to file for bankruptcy two weeks ago - but after it had negotiated about $550 million in concessions with its unions - Texas Pacific, based in Fort Worth and San Francisco, agreed to kick in $100 million as part of a $500 million loan to keep the company operating during bankruptcy. It also agreed to buy $200 million of stock, or 38 percent of the company, and take 5 of 13 seats on the board if US Airways emerges from bankruptcy - unless another investor surfaces with a better offer. ""One of the reasons we were interested is few other folks were,"" said James Coulter, a partner at Texas Pacific, in an interview after the bankruptcy filing. ""There aren't many people around with the stomach or the knowledge to delve into the airline industry."" Texas Pacific, which manages $8 billion, thrives by buying businesses no one else wants. Mr. Coulter and Mr. Bonderman made their names during the recession of the early 1990's with investments in Continental and America West. The firm's hallmark is to take an active hand in shaping companies, sometimes ousting poor managers and tapping its extensive network of contacts for talented replacements. Now the partners are again looking for trouble. In the last year alone, Texas Pacific has announced or completed six acquisitions, most in unloved industries like semiconductors, reinsurance and airlines. Just last month, it announced plans to buy Burger King, which has been losing market share, for $2.26 billion. It is also bidding for Bankgesellschaft Berlin, a large and troubled bank. The most creative, and potentially lucrative, of these deals could be Texas Pacific's acquisition last November of MEMC Electronic Materials, a semiconductor company, for $6 - yes, just $6 - in cash. It will also guarantee a $150 million bank loan. In the last few years, most firms that specialize in leveraged buyouts - the use of junk bonds, bank loans and other borrowings to buy or take big stakes in companies - have been largely inactive. Falling stock prices have made managements reluctant to sell cheaply. Companies that are for sale have tangled finances or face a cash squeeze. Texas Pacific is different. ""This is a terrific environment for them,"" said Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of the Blackstone Group, which also specializes in buyouts. Mark Attanasio, a managing director at Trust Company of the West, which has invested with Texas Pacific, said: ""Most other buyout firms want to buy companies that are growing. You don't see many guys wanting to take on operational fixes."" Like most other buyout firms, Texas Pacific tries to keep its inner workings private: its partners rarely grant interviews and its Web site is perpetually under construction. Mr. Bonderman, Mr. Coulter and William Price, the third founding partner, declined to be interviewed for this article. Mr. Bonderman, 59, is known for his rumpled shirts and bright, patterned socks. ""He likes argyle socks, and they tend to fall down around his ankles,"" said Henry Miller, an investment banker who advises troubled companies. Early in his career, when he was a Washington lawyer, Mr. Bonderman argued a case in court wearing a brown velvet suit. When a Texas Pacific deal is being negotiated, he is known for obsessively staying in touch, even when he is trekking in places like Pakistan, Nepal and, most recently, Bhutan. ""Whenever I see a long, unfamiliar phone number pop up on my caller I.D., I know it's David calling,"" said one investment banker who often works with Mr. Bonderman. Mr. Bonderman made his reputation in the 1980's as the chief investment officer for Robert Bass, the Texas oilman. Mr. Bonderman enriched Mr. Bass a second time by making early bets in industries like cable television and taking stakes in troubled companies like American Savings & Loan, which had been seized by the government. Over nearly a decade, Mr. Bonderman's picks earned an average annual return of 63 percent for Mr. Bass. In 1993, Mr. Bonderman struck out on his own with Mr. Coulter, a former Lehman Brothers banker who had also worked for Mr. Bass. They teamed up later that year with Mr. Price, a veteran of GE Capital Capital and Bain & Company, a consulting firm, to form Texas Pacific. The three men have complementary skills, investment bankers and other deal makers said. Mr. Bonderman is the master strategist and Mr. Coulter is good at structuring deals and the detailed management of the firm's purchases. Mr. Price often recruits managers and advises on operational issues. ""David is very much the optimist, very much the deal maker,"" said Greg Brenneman, a former president of Continental. ""Jim is very much a counterbalance to David. He will sit back and ask the tough questions. He will approach investments a little bit more skeptically than David does."" By the end of the 1990's, Texas Pacific was well established in deal making. It easily raised $4.5 billion from pension funds and other investors in early 2000. To celebrate their war chest, the firm's partners rented San Francisco's City Hall and hired the B-52's to play at a party. But as the stock market began to tumble, Texas Pacific hesitated. For a 17-month stretch, the partners made no deals. They checked out some of the biggest corporate blowups, including Adelphia, Xerox and Global Crossing, but stayed away, finding the prices and the quality of the businesses untenable. Instead, Texas Pacific began to hastily exit some existing investments, taking more than $2 billion in profits during that stretch. ""They started to cash out early in the cycle,"" said Mario Giannini, chief executive of Hamilton Lane, a money management firm, some of whose clients are Texas Pacific investors. The good times of the late 1990's were not ideal for Texas Pacific - it struggled to find downtrodden companies that needed its help. But Texas Pacific did manage to spot a few diamonds in the rough. It revived Oxford Health Plans, the health maintenance organization that nearly collapsed in the mid-1990's, almost doubling its money after bringing in new managers and upgrading computer systems. In 1996, it made a $280 million investment in Ducati Motor, the Italian motorcycle maker, whose profits have since more than quadrupled. But Texas Pacific also stumbled, usually when it bought at the top of the market. Texas Pacific's $560 million investment in the J. Crew Group, the clothing retailer, for which it paid a steep price of 10 times cash flow in 1997, has been a disappointment. So has its 1999 purchase of Bally, the shoe maker, which has suffered from lower demand for luxury goods. Texas Pacific also lost more than $100 million on Zilog, a semiconductor company, and Favorite Brands, a candy maker, both of which filed for bankruptcy. Some of these investments have taken a toll on the firm's performance. Texas Pacific is still selling off holdings in two investment funds it raised over the last decade. The first fund, a $720 million portfolio raised in 1993 and including investments made through March 1997, should return more than 40 percent, according to one Texas Pacific investor. But its second fund - $2.5 billion raised in 1997 - could return less than half that, this investor estimated, since the firm had less time to take profits on these investments before the stock market sank. But because Texas Pacific has not sold many of its holdings in the second fund, profits on these investments could rebound. It is hoping, for example, that with new management in place, J. Crew will turn around as the economy rebounds. In any case, one competitor said, ""their returns look pretty good when you consider that some other funds won't return any capital"" to investors. But with the weak economy throwing many companies into trouble, Texas Pacific seems poised to repeat its earlier success, the investor said. ""They should do exceptionally well,"" he said. Texas Pacific has a distinct style - if not formula. It relies on talented, self-sufficient managers to restructure troubled companies, preferring to remain hands-off, except for surveillance from the boardroom. When necessary, it replaces managers. Less than a year after Continental emerged from bankruptcy, for example, Mr. Bonderman watched with frustration as his old friend Robert R. Ferguson, the chief executive, led it to the edge of another trip to bankruptcy court. Continental's board, where Mr. Bonderman was chairman, then brought in Gordon M. Bethune, an executive at Boeing, and in October 1994 he replaced Mr. Ferguson as chief executive. Mr. Bethune quickly did a top-to-bottom overhaul of the company and is now considered a great turnaround artist of the industry. ""The biggest conflict I've ever seen was with Bob Ferguson,"" said Clark Onstad, a former general counsel for the Federal Aviation Administration, in describing the thinking of Mr. Bonderman, whom he has known since the 1982 Braniff bankruptcy. ""He chose Bethune over his longtime friend Ferguson because he thought Bethune would do a better job."" At America West, Texas Pacific initiated an even more extensive management overhaul. This time, the charge was led by Mr. Coulter and Mr. Schifter, both directors. W. Douglas Parker, the current chief executive, flew to Mr. Coulter's home in San Francisco to interview for the job of chief financial officer. They talked for hours, and Mr. Parker said the two men quickly realized they had ""somewhat kindred spirits."" The board replaced most senior managers at America West, except William Franke, the chief executive, who stepped down last September. His restructuring plan had made the airline profitable a year and a half before it emerged from bankruptcy in August 1994. Texas Pacific owns just 3 percent of America West, worth about $33.7 million. But those are controlling shares, and the group holds more than 50 percent of the votes. ""These are not passive investors, nor am I,"" said Donald L. Sturm, a Denver businessman who serves on Continental's board with Mr. Bonderman and Mr. Price. ""You're active. Your money is at stake. Your reputation is at stake."" After overseeing managers who worked successfully with unions at Continental and America West, Texas Pacific has a good reputation with labor. That was one reason US Airways was interested in a Texas Pacific investment, said Chris Chiames, a spokesman for the airline. Mr. Siegel wanted an investor who would ""be as labor friendly as possible,"" Mr. Chiames said. But US Airways can still entertain other bids this fall, and Marvin Davis, the billionaire investor from Los Angeles, has expressed interest. Texas Pacific's investment in Burger King, made with Goldman, Sachs and Bain Capital, was announced after two years of discussions among Texas Pacific's partners and the chain's franchisees - even before the company, which had been owned by Diageo, the liquor company, was put up for sale, said Julian Josephson, chairman of the National Franchisee Association, which represents most Burger King franchisees. ""We liked what they had to say about the human component of the businesses they buy,"" Mr. Josephson said. Many other owners, he added, ""are dismissive of labor."" At Burger King, Texas Pacific will also be working with an executive it knows. Burger King's chief executive is John Dasburg, the former chief executive of Northwest Airlines, who met Mr. Bonderman and his partners when Northwest bought out their stake in Continental in 1998. Unlike most buyout firms, Texas Pacific remains enamored with the technology industry, despite the failure of so many start-ups the last two years. It has focused on the semiconductor industry, which like the airline industry is highly cyclical. So far, though, results have been mixed. The firm's 1996 acquisition of the Paradyne Corporation, which makes equipment for high-speed Internet connections, has been a huge success. Texas Pacific split it in two and took both parts public in the late 1990's, selling most of its stakes for 23 times its investment. But a much larger investment, its $400 million acquisition of Zilog, the chip maker, in 1998, was made just before the economic crisis in Asia caused chip prices to plummet. Zilog filed for bankruptcy last year. Texas Pacific is still hoping for a turnaround at a third company, ON Semiconductor, which it acquired for $1.6 billion three years ago. It invested $100 million more last year. Its latest gamble on the industry, the $6 deal for MEMC, may prove the most lucrative. The cost of mailing the payment to E.On, based in D�sseldorf, Germany, was actually more than the acquisition, one executive close to the deal said. Texas Pacific, and its partners in the deal, Trust Company of the West and Leonard Green & Partners, agreed to guarantee a $150 million revolving line of credit. Texas Pacific also assumed $900 million worth of debt, most of which it swapped for more stock in the company. ""They did a good job of timing the acquisition,"" said Nabeel Gareeb, the company's chief executive, who noted that in the last quarter MEMC reported its first profit since the fourth quarter of 2000. But Texas Pacific's interest in airlines is clearly sizable. Besides its involvement in Continental, America West and US Airways, the company plans to buy Gate Gourmet, the catering business of the bankrupt Swissair Group. Two years ago, Texas Pacific started a Web-based discount ticket service called Hotwire. It put up most of the $75 million in seed money, then persuaded six airlines to invest with it, said Karl Peterson, the chief executive. Hotwire, instead of asking consumers to bid on tickets, as Priceline does, shows the cheapest ticket on its Web site but does not reveal the exact flight and travel time until after the sale. The contraction of the new economy has undoubtedly hurt Hotwire, which is privately owned. Mr. Peterson said that the company was still unprofitable but that Texas Pacific remains committed to it. Last spring, Mr. Peterson met Mr. Bonderman in Aspen to talk about Hotwire and to go snowboarding. Mr. Bonderman seemed perfectly willing to accompany Hotwire down the steep Internet chute. But he does have his limits on risk, Mr. Peterson discovered. Before going down the mountain, Mr. Bonderman strapped on a helmet. � http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/25/business/yourmoney/25TEXA.html?ex=1031278887&ei=1&en=05fca479b8bcee6b HOW TO ADVERTISE --------------------------------- For information on advertising in e-mail newsletters or other creative advertising opportunities with The New York Times on the Web, please contact onlinesales@nytimes.com or visit our online media kit at http://www.nytimes.com/adinfo For general information about NYTimes.com, write to help@nytimes.com.

Seriously, diversity is something record companies can't afford anymore - not the majors, at any rate. I'd go to this article, posted at Linux Journal, which quotes a Newsweet article (July 15,2002) by Steven Levy saying ""So why are the record labels taking such a hard line? My guess is that it's all about protecting their Internet-challenged business model. Their profit comes from blockbuster artists. If the industry moved to a more varied ecology, independent labels and artists would thrive--to the detriment of the labels, which would have trouble rustling up the rubes to root for the next Britney. The smoking gun comes from testimony of an RIAA-backed economist who told the government fee panel that a dramatic shakeout in Webcasting is ""inevitable and desirable because it will bring about market consolidation."" That's really it in a nutshell. ""Market consolidation"" means the less artists they have to promote, the less ultimate dollars they'll spend. The smaller the playlist, the greater the chance that audiences will buy something from that playlist alone - because that's all you'll be able to find out there.

I have been trying to use sendmail, but am finding it to be an absolute pain in the posterior, and when the relay server will only accept outgoing connections if I have checked for incoming mail in the last twenty minutes, and I don't know how to set sendmail to run a command before it sends out the mail. Do any of the outgoing mailer programs, exim or postfix or whatever, have a 'nice' configuration interface, or do they all have nice friendly configuration files like sendmail. Any suggestions of alternative solutions would be much appreciated. There are only three or four email addresses in my domain, and setting it up for scheduled collection and either scheduled or immediate delivery would do me fine. Thanks, David.

I think my mail wasn't very clear ;-) My point was that we should continue releasing new rules and removing broken ones (all based on discussions on this list of course) in the 2.4 branch instead of creating a new 2.5 branch everytime we have a bunch of new rules. A new branch should be openend only if (big) new features are introduced (eg. Bayes) or the interface has changed (spam_level_char=x). As the rules are under fluent development, the user has to update quite regularly. But currently he couldn't be shure if the new release will break anything in his setup (like -F going away). So if we say ""the branches are stable to the outside and just improved under the surface but you have to watch out when you update to a new minor version number"", users and sysadmins could be less reluctant to update.

bugzilla-daemon@hughes-family.org,[SAdev] [Bug 1012] negate directive addition,"http://www.hughes-family.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1012 ------- Additional Comments From easmith@beatrice.rutgers.edu 2002-09-21 16:41 ------- I like this idea, but from my reading - part of my dissertation research - on GAs (or, in this case, more precisely ""Evolutionary Programming"", since the parameters are non-binary and the major operator is mutation, not crossover), you do need to keep in mind that the more interactions there are between different variables, the better-tweaked the GA/EA will need to be, especially to avoid local optima (which may have been the problem with the suspiciously-high ""anti-ratware"" USER_AGENT scores). From past results, what's needed are one or more of the below: A. Determine mutational parameters by adapted-scores themselves, with variation on a per-original score basis; ideally, allow for having ""correlated"" mutations - in other words, have a mechanism in place for trying out changes to a bunch of scores at once, with them all moving about the same amount (albeit possibly in different directions) - one means to do this is found in the ""Evolutionary Strategies"" of Schwefel; B. Adapt the probability of a mutation taking place depending on how well previous mutation tries have done - if more than about a fifth of the new ""individuals"" are doing about as well as, or better than, the parental generation, then mutate more parameters; if less than a fifth of them are doing about as well as, or better than, the parental generation, then mutate less parameters. -Allen ------- You are receiving this mail because: ------- You are the assignee for the bug, or are watching the assignee. ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek Welcome to geek heaven. http://thinkgeek.com/sf _______________________________________________ Spamassassin-devel mailing list Spamassassin-devel@lists.sourceforge.net https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-devel",0

Robert Elz <kre@munnari.OZ.AU>,Re: Anolther sequence related traceback,"I have some patches that seem to fix/avoid this problem now. (It is amazing what one can achieve when mains power fails, long enough for UPS's to run out, and all that is left operational is the laptop and its battery supply...) First, I put in some defensive code into the area where the problem was occurring, so that if exmh is attempting (for any reason) to expand a sequence that isn't either a number, or a range of numbers (or a list of such things) it will simply ignore the trash, rather than giving a traceback. This one solves the initial problem: --- mh.tcl.WAS Thu Aug 22 21:15:06 2002 +++ mh.tcl Wed Aug 28 12:39:11 2002 @@ -487,6 +487,10 @@ set seq {} set rseq {} foreach range [split [string trim $sequence]] { + if ![regexp {^[0-9]+(-[0-9]+)?$} $range] { + # just ignore anything bogus + continue; + } set parts [split [string trim $range] -] if {[llength $parts] == 1} { lappend seq $parts That is amending proc MhSeqExpand which is where the error was occurring before (the code assumes that $range is either NNN or NNN-MMM so we should probably make sure that's true - issue an error instead of just ""continue"" if you like, but I don't think an error is needed). But that just allowed me to create a similar problem, in another place, by typing ""NNN-"" ... and rather than continue to fight fires like this, I thought I should think more about Brent's suggestion. But rather than have the selection code actually validate the input, which would mean it would have to know what is to be valid, I decided that the right thing to do is just to ignore any errors caused by invalid input, so I just stuck a ""catch"" around the MsgShow that is processing the nonsense that the user has typed. This way, any later expansion to what MsgShow treats as legal (maybe allowing a sequence name, like ""prev"" or ""next"", or anything else can be handled just there, without someone needing to remember that they have to go fix the selection processing code to allow it. But, while I was playing there, I noticed something I never new before. If you type ""66+"" the ""66"" changes to ""67"" (and so on, for each + that is typed). I suspect that's perhaps an artifact of ""+ is bound to a different function so it can be used as a toggle between changing the current and the target folder, but it has to mean something if the current input mode is a message number, so let it mean..."", but now I found it, I think its nice. But if we can type 66+ why not 66- as well? That kind of limitation bugs me, so I fixed it. And then I wondered about folders with names containing '+' - the special use of + as the toggle character means there's no way to type those from the keyboard. So I fixed that as well. This makes two different restrictions - there's no way to type a folder name that has a name beginning with '+' (but such a thing in MH would be a pain to use anyway, so I doubt this will bother anyone), and it is now only possible to toggle between typing the current & target folder name when the name being typed is empty. I'm less happy about that part, but I think I can live with it in order to allow folder names with +'s in them to exist and be typed. Then, since I was there anyway, I decided to do something about another feature that has always bugged me. In ""normal"" keyboard mode, 's' is the key used to show a message. But if you've just typed 123, and the FTOC is highlighting 123 as the current message, and you want to now show that message, you can't type 's', you have to type \r instead. So I ""fixed"" this one as well. ""Fixed"" here is in quotes, as it assumes that the keybinding for MsgShow is 's', if you change that to something else, it will remain 's' in here. I don't know enough tk/tcl to have it discover what key is bound to a function in the external world in order to bind the same one here. \r continues to work of course. And now I got started in fixing irritants in this code, I also made it clear the status line if you abort message/folder entry mode (^C or ^G). Previously it used to leave the prompt sitting there until the next message appeared, which made it less than obvious that the keyboard had reverted to its usual bindings. In any case, what follows is the patch that does all of that. I believe that if you apply this, then the one above is probably not needed, the ""catch"" around the ""MsgShow"" will hide the problem (I don't think we really need to fix Brent's way of invoking it). Or include it anyway, just for completeness (I haven't run an exmh with the following patch, but not the previous one, so I don't know for sure that all will be OK then). kre --- select.tcl.WAS Thu Aug 22 21:15:07 2002 +++ select.tcl Wed Aug 28 13:36:17 2002 @@ -49,9 +49,11 @@ bindtags $w [list $w Entry] bind $w <Any-Key> {SelectTypein %W %A} bind $w <Key-plus> {SelectToggle %W } + bind $w <Key-minus> {SelectPrev %W } bind $w <space> {SelectComplete %W} bind $w <Tab> {SelectComplete %W} bind $w <Return> {SelectReturn %W} + bind $w <Key-s> {SelectReturn %W %A} bind $w <BackSpace> {SelectBackSpace %W} bind $w <Control-h> {SelectBackSpace %W} bind $w <Delete> {SelectBackSpace %W} @@ -72,7 +74,7 @@ append select(sel) $a Exmh_Status ""$select(prompt) $select(sel)"" if ![info exists select(folder)] { - Msg_Change $select(sel) noshow + catch { Msg_Change $select(sel) noshow } } } proc SelectBackSpace { w } { @@ -91,6 +93,10 @@ proc SelectToggle {w} { global select if [info exists select(folder)] { + if {$select(sel) != """"} { + SelectTypein $w + + return + } set select(toggle) [list [lindex $select(toggle) 1] [lindex $select(toggle) 0]] set select(prompt) ""[lindex $select(toggle) 0] Folder:"" } else { @@ -101,6 +107,18 @@ } Exmh_Status ""$select(prompt) $select(sel)"" } +proc SelectPrev {w} { + global select + if [info exists select(folder)] { + SelectTypein $w ""-"" + } else { + catch { + incr select(sel) -1 + Msg_Change $select(sel) noshow + } + Exmh_Status ""$select(prompt) $select(sel)"" + } +} proc SelectComplete { w } { global select if [info exists select(folder)] { @@ -126,9 +144,13 @@ Exmh_Status ""$select(prompt) $select(sel)"" } } -proc SelectReturn { w } { +proc SelectReturn { w {a {}} } { global select if [info exists select(folder)] { + if {$a != {}} { + SelectTypein $w $a + return + } if [info exists select(match)] { set select(sel) $select(match) unset select(match) @@ -151,6 +173,7 @@ unset select(folder) } $select(entry) configure -state disabled + Exmh_Status """" Exmh_Focus } proc SelectClear { w } { _______________________________________________ Exmh-workers mailing list Exmh-workers@redhat.com https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-workers",0

As to religion, I think it is harmful and risky in almost any degree. Were I single, I might consider potential mates who partook of the less irrational or more light-hearted religions. A Unitarian or Buddhist might be an example of the first, a Wiccan of the second. But someone who is both irrational and serious about that irrationality strikes me as a bad choice of partner, moreso than someone who was addicted to some drug. Alcoholics and drug addicts at least have the sense to battle their problem, and to keep their children from suffering it. The religious revel in their irrationality, and want to raise their children in it. That's a difficult difference for two parents to reconcile.

Mark David Chapman, 47, was jailed for life after he admitted killing the superstar outside his New York apartment building in 1980. It is the second time in two years that Chapman has sought parole from Attica state prison. At a 2000 hearing, he argued that he was no longer a danger to society and had overcome the psychological problems which led him to shoot the ex-Beatle. Chapman had said that a voice in his head told him to shoot the star. Shot dead Lennon was shot four times as he emerged from a limousine outside his New York City apartment on 8 December 1980. He and his wife Yoko Ono were returning from a late-night recording session during which time they had been working on Walking on Thin Ice. Only hours before the shooting, Chapman - who had come to New York from Hawaii - was photographed with the singer outside the same building as Lennon signed a copy of his album Double Fantasy for him. The killer said Lennon had been just ""a picture on an album cover"" to him before the shooting. 'Deserved death' Chapman has said that he should have received the death penalty for his crime. Lennon's widow told the 2000 parole hearing that she would not feel safe if Chapman were released. Lennon's songwriting partnership with Paul McCartney propelled the Liverpool-based pop group to international stardom and unparalleled commercial success. The Beatles front man, peace campaigner, and all-round iconoclast, would have been 62 on Wednesday. ------------------------ Yahoo!

I tried the ""Anthony"" stuff, but it didn't make any appreciable difference that I could see from staring at the false negative rate. The numbers are big enough that a quick eyeball suffices. Then I tried a dirt simple tokenizer for the headers that tokenize the words in the header and emitted like this ""%s: %s"" % (hdr, word). That worked too well :-). The received and date headers helped the classifier discover that most of my spam is old and most of my ham is new. So I tried a slightly more complex one that skipped received, data, and x-from_, which all contained timestamps. I also skipped the X-VM- headers that my mail reader added: class MyTokenizer(Tokenizer): skip = {'received': 1, 'date': 1, 'x-from_': 1, } def tokenize_headers(self, msg): for k, v in msg.items(): k = k.lower() if k in self.skip or k.startswith('x-vm'): continue for w in subject_word_re.findall(v): for t in tokenize_word(w): yield ""%s:%s"" % (k, t) This did moderately better. The false negative rate is 7-21% over the tests performed so far. This is versus 11-28% for the previous test run that used the timtest header tokenizer. It's interesting to see that the best descriminators are all ham discriminators. There's not a single spam-indicator in the list. Most of the discriminators are header fields. One thing to note is that the presence of Mailman-generated headers is a strong non-spam indicator. That matches my intuition: I got an awful lot of Mailman-generated mail, and those lists are pretty good at surpressing spam. The other thing is that I get a lot of ham from people who use XEmacs. That's probably Barry, Guido, Fred, and me :-). One final note. It looks like many of the false positives are from people I've never met with questions about Shakespeare. They often start with stuff like: > Dear Sir/Madam, > > May I please take some of your precious time to ask you to help me to find a > solution to a problem that is worrying me greatly.

My primary issue is the magnitude of the negative score and that it was not determined empirically. I am also concerned that it was added after the rules freeze, that such a major change was not discussed in advance, etc. There's also no evidence that the rule will actually reduce FPs.

Well, I think my avifile build still needs the win32 codecs to be able to run (manually copied into /usr/lib/win32/), but personally, I've been very happy with mplayer's default (which is ffmpeg's ffdivx decoder) for nearly all the DivX files I used. The only ones that still require (from my own experience) the use of the win32 codecs are the ones encoded with a strange DivX 3 sound format... and I've really not seen any quality or speed improvements when using them.

boingboing <rssfeeds@example.com>,Football players addicted to video football,"URL: http://boingboing.net/#85531549 Date: Not supplied Pro football players are addicted to football games, as a means of wish-fulfillment -- by ""managing"" the team, they can be free of the rule of their coaches and bosses. Maybe this explains the amazing success of The Sims, which, on the face of it, should be dull as hell: While away your free time away from the office by simulating an existence as a shlub with a day-job and a drive to acquire consumer goods on credit. You'd think it'd be the last thing you want to do. But it's not. When you're a Sim, you can tweak your existence a smidge, discover what life would be like if you took Path A instead of Path B, try the alternate universe on for size. The idea of football players playing themselves in licensed video games is neat and recursive, like the episode of the Simpsons when Mr. Burns runs into Krusty buying Krusty-O's at the supermarket and asks where he can find the ""Burns-O's."" ""It's always a trip,"" Carr says. ""The first time I saw myself in a video game was in college (at Fresno State) when I walked into a Best Buy store and some kid was playing with me. That kind of trips you out a little bit."" For every 12-year-old kid who spends countless hours in front of a television playing video games, there's a group of 300-pound offensive linemen challenging each other at everything from Madden NFL 2003 to the action-packed ""Halo: Combat Evolved.""

There's promising replacements forms, but this is the current state of the industry: o You find something that you want to fill out. It's a partnership form, a signup for a Web seminar, a request for more information, anything. o You start wasting time typing in all those stupid fields and spend about 10 minutes going through all their stupid qualification hoops just to get a small piece of information , whitepaper, or a callback when halfway through, you start to wonder if it's really worth your time to forever be stuck on their stupid prospect list. o Pull down tags are never put in order of use instead of alphabetized. I was on a site just now that had every single country in the world listed; the selection of your country was absolutely critical for you to hit submit, but due to the layout, the ""more>"" tag on the second row was offscreen so it was impossible to select any country except about two dozen third world countries. o Even worse, ever time you hit submit, all forms based things complain about using the universal country phone number format and will cause you to re-enter dashes instead of dots. o When you get something that's not entered right, you will go back and enter it right, but then some other field or most likely pulldown will automatically get reset to the default value so that you will have to go back and resent that freaking thing too. Finally after all combinations of all pulldowns, you may get a successful submit. o You wait freaking forever just to get a confirmation. o Sometimes, like today, you won't be able to ever submit anything due to it being impossible to ever submit a valid set of information that is internally non-conflicting according to whatever fhead wrote their forms submission. What's wrong with this picture? The company is screwing you by wasting your time enforcing their data collection standards on you. I'm sure there's someone in that company that would be willing to accept ""US"", ""U.S"", ""USA"" ""United States"", ""U of A"", ""America"", etc. and would know exactly which freaking country the interested party was from instead of forcing them to waste even more time playing Web form geography.

Trading standards officers, working for Greenwich Council, were alerted to the situation after a Bryan punch bag, purchased in Argos, in Charlton Road, Charlton, was found to be full of bandages. Also stuffed inside the piece of sporting equipment was a letter from a woman in Fife stating how she felt quite disgusted' about the bag and asking for the filling to be tested. The unfortunate shopper had bought his first bag, at Argos, in Lewisham High Street, but had returned it because on investigation of a leak he was horrified to discover it was filled with incontinence pads. So far, officers have purchased two of the punch bags, only to find they contain incontinence pads and strips of shredded duvet. Cabinet member for public services Councillor Angela Cornforth said: ""This is one of the strangest stories I have every heard. ""Our officers are in the process of investigating and will no doubt discover why the bags contain such unusual contents."" 12:18 Tuesday 8th October 2002 _________________________________________________________________ Chat with friends online, try MSN Messenger: http://messenger.msn.com ------------------------ Yahoo!

What he doesn't mention: if you lower the price on the only product you're selling, you have a revenue hit, which will not make your investors happy, and you may run out of money and have to close. But that must be what he's thinking. [1] http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/WorstProjectEver.html [2] http://www.ozzie.net/blog/stories/2002/09/24/softwarePlatformDynamics.html",0

I have the 10:15 doctor's appointment that I should have made last round, had I not convinced myself that &#8220;it's not that bad&#8221; and trudged through it all without prescription drugs. I'm not making the same mistake this time. I'll be back this afternoon. My email problems of yesterday have been resolved. You can once again reach me at my normal address, f8dy@diveintomark.org. Kevin Burton[1] emailed me with another way to link to a FOAF file from my RSS feed. It looks easier than previous suggestions, and it has the advantage of being able to use it from an RSS 1.0 or 2.0 feed, but I worry about all these variations. Just as in real life, where people can use different words that mean essentially the same thing, in the Semantic Web programs can use different vocabularies to express the same statements. That's great for producers, not so great for consumers who have to make sense of it all. For each domain (RSS feeds, FOAF files, whatever), somebody (or some group) needs to come along and document best practices. We need better _goal-oriented_ documentation. We have a lot of reference documentation, task-oriented documentation, but very little that documents that larger picture and answers questions written in English. &#8220;How do I include personal information in my RSS feed?&#8221; is a goal-oriented question. &#8220;Create a FOAF file using this tool and then insert this line at this location in your RSS feed&#8221; (with as many examples as necessary) is a goal-oriented answer.

This is not a correct assessment. The American public couldn't care less. However, the US intelligence community correctly perceives a threat, and it isn't the third-world. Many European and other developed nations aggressively engage in covert operations against American interests. Its been going on for years and isn't even news. Things have stepped up in recent years and the US DoD is none too pleased. For better or worse, the US is relatively good at that game too. As with most backwater wars, they are proxies for the interests of the big players. Find a current list of the top intelligence threats to the US. You'll find that half the countries on that list are European. Most people are unaware of how aggressive these things have gotten in recent years. > On the other hand the Europeans are used to the peace of their cozy > post-war system where external security is not an issue. All security > threads can be resolved by giving money to the threatening people > and to integrate them into the wealthy sphere (Balkan, Palestinians, > ...) Bullshit. The European governments ruthlessly suppress real opposition, obviously some more than others. US SpecOps are often brought in to do dirty work inside Europe for European governments (usually with government ""advisors"" along for the mission). I've always wondered what the deal was such that we got involved at all. The point being that we've acted as assassins for European governments inside their borders against their own citizens under the auspices of those governments, and in recent years, not ancient history. I know SpecOp guys who left the military specifically because of the circumstances of some of these missions while they were posted for that duty. I'm certainly glad I was never assigned missions in that theater, because there is a lot of covert nastiness going on in nominally friendly European democracies. Regardless, giving money to people that threaten you has never created meaningful peace in the history of civilization. We call it extortion under any other guise. > A lot of the current EU - US issues can be explained by this difference > of perception, such as the current American unilateralism (nobody wants > to help us!), the American arrogance towards Europe (they don't want to > do anything, so why should we ask them?) and the growing rejection of the > American policy in Europe (they want to abolish the law!). Europe is looking increasingly like a basket case. Whatever problems the US is having these days, Europe looks worse and is going downhill faster. Why the US would want to emulate European behavior or the European way of doing things is beyond me. The US asking for major policy advice from Europe is like asking a quack for medical advice. I really don't see what is wrong with ""unilateral"" anyway. Why should anyone join a stampede that is heading for a cliff? I hope the incessant knee-jerk conformist screeching that Americans see coming from Europe doesn't actually represent the views of Europeans. For various reasons I'm not exactly a cheerleader for the US government, but the premises of the argument against them here are lame. > My personal point is that few Americans (percentage of overall population) > have ever left their country, while even German construction workers > regularly spend their holidays in Spain. So I'm not surprised that > paranoia is growing. I'm betting you are underestimating the actual percentage. The vast majority of people I know have lived, worked, and traveled outside the country at one time or another. And I doubt Europeans have traveled anywhere near as much in the Western hemisphere as Americans have. Despite the best efforts of France, Europe is *still* not the center of the universe. I'll throw you a bone though: most Americans do consider Europe to be drifting into irrelevancy and therefore ignore it. But from the perspective of an American, how could you NOT look at it this way? The impact of Europe on America has diminished greatly over the years. I love the smell of Euro-chauvinism in the morning. First, you assume that the North American continent is ethnically and culturally homogenous. Anybody that has actually traveled throughout North America knows this isn't true; there are more than five major and very distinct cultures and societies in the US alone, never mind the hundreds of diverse regional sub-populations, some of which are truly foreign. Apparently Europeans confuse speaking the same language with having the same culture. That would be like saying Mexico is culturally identical to Spain because they nominally speak the same language. A Wyoming rancher has almost nothing in common culturally or socially with your average person living in San Francisco, despite speaking the same language and nominally living in the same country. If I want to visit a wildly different culture for the holidays, I'll go to Oakland, New Orleans, or similar -- they are far more different from where I live than some countries I've traveled to. And a lot of these places are farther from where I live than Spain is from Germany. Second, the State I live in is the size of Germany. When I travel to a neighboring State (which I do regularly), how is this not equivalent? In fact, I probably travel much farther for the holidays than your German construction workers. If you look at the EU as a single country, only then does your analogy become comparable. What kind of ridiculous superiority do Europeans get from having (relatively) tiny countries? In truth, I find Europe to be about as culturally homogeneous as the US. There are a lot of cultural similarities across the EU with relatively minor local deviations that vary with distance in ways very similar to the US. The only real difference is that Europeans have dozens of different languages, which is hardly something I would call an advantage. Although there are a couple parts of the US where I can't understand a word they are saying either. -James Rogers jamesr@best.com",0

The tacit acknowledgement and self-limiting you speak of is not a given or a function of 'sophistication' but is primarily a feature of (current) Western Civilization. Of course, 'sophisticated' and 'Western Civilization' are essentially equivalent IMHO.

And sometimes the religious component is a façade for an equally dangerous ethnic affiliation. Hindu extremism isn't about the Hindu religious theology as far as I can see.

That is a fully retarded view of economics, and pretty much the same kind of clueless oversimplication that led to the blackouts. There are a bazillion factors that affect game strategies, which is what the state of California messed up and the energy producers exploited. I'm not convinced that the only way to prevent future energy debacles like the blackouts is to reregulate. Ultimately we have to blame the people who crafted the game rules in a way that invited blackouts and exploitation. Given that the particular set of rules crafted by the state of California sucked, does there exist a set of rules that doesn't suck? If there does exist a better set of rules, then reregulation isn't necessarily the answer. You can't blame businesses for being profit maximizers. Yes, the people involved were heartless and corrupt. But mainly they just did their jobs. The guilty parties are either the mathematicians and economists who wrote the rules or, if the mathematicians and economists said there were no good rules, pro-deregulation politicians who went ahead anyway. - Lucas",0

The executive director of the World Food Programme, James Morris, said Zimbabwe's decision would send an important message to other countries in the region which have refused food aid because it might contain GM grain. Until now, Zimbabwe had said it would only allow aid workers to distribute ground maize to allay fears that GM grain could be planted. But a Zimbabwean minister says the government has now set up a system of checks to ensure the grain will not enter the eco-system. There have been fears that Southern African nations could lose lucrative export markets in Europe if they cannot certify that their crops are GM-free. Aid Mr Morris announced the policy reversal after talks in Harare with Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe. ""The fact that they have now concluded that they are comfortable in accepting GM crops or commodities will be an important signal to other countries in the region,"" Mr Morris told journalists. ""It will enable us to do our job,"" he said. Aid workers say up to 13 million people in seven countries in Southern Africa face famine. In Zimbabwe which was once the bread basket of the region, some six million people are estimated to need food aid. The WFP says it already has aid pledges for about half of the 600,000 tonnes of food it intends to bring into Zimbabwe in the next few months. The government blames the shortages solely on drought, but the government's campaign to transfer land from large scale commercial white farmers has worsened the situation, say many donors. Lost markets The GM row has complicated relief efforts across the region. Zambia's president is refusing to overturn his ban on GM food aid, labelling it as 'poison' . Deals to mill GM food before being distributed, so that it could not be planted, have placated fears in Malawi and Mozambique. United States aid officials deny that the food is unsafe, pointing out that Americans eat GM maize every day.

The astounding thing about java is that despite all of the many significant points in its favor, it still manages to suck, and break across JVMs. I was really looking forward to being able to use a better language like java and get it compiled to real platform-specific binaries via the GNU compiler collection. But this seems to have never really gotten anywhere because it would require porting or reimplementing libraries, which are probably not source-available or tolerably licenced.

bitbitch@magnesium.net,Re[2]: Goodbye Global Warming,"How about this: A bored FoRKer said: ""YAWN"" I believe Tom had it right. Signal not noise. I'll start: Los Angeles Times September 23, 2002 Monday Copyright 2002 / Los Angeles Times Los Angeles Times September 23, 2002 Monday Home Edition SECTION: Main News Main News; Part 1; Page 13; National Desk LENGTH: 1013 words BYLINE: DANA CALVO, TIMES STAFF WRITER DATELINE: SEATTLE BODY: The idea came at the end of a long, frustrating brown-bag session at a public-policy think tank here. The challenge was to save the city's child-care programs. Staring into his empty coffee cup, the meeting coordinator's mind landed on an unlikely solution: Put a tax--just a ""benign"" dime a shot--on espresso. That led to a petition signed by more than 20,000 Seattle residents, and next year, voters will decide whether the tax becomes law, one that taps right into Seattle's legendary addiction to coffee. This is, after all, the town where Starbucks was born and where the $12 pound of beans became a staple. There is one Starbucks for every 7,000 residents in Seattle, compared to one per 64,000 in New York. Seattle also has two other major coffee chains, Tully's Coffee and Seattle's Best Coffee, as well as countless cafes and espresso carts. A recent poll showed that 74% of Seattle residents would vote for the tax. ""For people outside of Seattle who don't understand the consumption of espresso, [the tax proposal] can be seen as crazy,"" said John Burbank, the think tank's executive director, ""but it was common sense."" Research by his nonprofit Economic Opportunity Institute showed that people preferred a tax on liquor or beer over one on espresso. But because of the large number of lattes and cappuccinos sold, a tax on espresso could be lower than one levied on alcohol. Burbank estimates the tax could generate $7 million to $10 million a year. City Council aides dispute his figures, saying their research shows the tax would bring in $1.5 million to $3 million a year. Burbank's institute is funded by foundations and labor unions. The think tank's mission is to promote public policy in the interests of low-income people, and it has long championed child-care issues. Burbank says the tax would restore cuts to the child-care programs made earlier this year by Gov. Gary Locke. He also says it would provide more low-income families with subsidies for child care, improve preschool programs and increase teacher salaries. At Bauhaus Books & Coffee, the sidewalk is dotted with tables of customers for whom coffee is a half-day activity, not just a drink. Espresso lovers like Chris Altman, who at a dime a day would spend an extra $36.50 a year, said the investment is worth it. ""I'm OK with it,"" said the 35-year-old, stirring his iced latte. ""The money's got to come from somewhere."" Hope Revuelto, 25, was cooling her regular coffee ($1 because she brought her own mug) and reading ""Zen and the Art of Pottery."" She supports the initiative and said its critics are behaving as would be expected of espresso drinkers: They want the most expensive thing on the menu but resist paying 10 cents to help the needy. Some say the tax isn't the issue; they just resent being singled out. David Marsh, 45, a costume manager, drinks up to three espressos a day, which means he'd be shelling out an extra $109.50 a year. ""I, for one, don't have kids, but I drink espresso,"" he said, as he sewed a leather collar onto a chain-mail tunic. ""I don't mind paying, but I think everyone should pay."" Coffeehouses are steamed about it, and they've organized as JOLT--Joined to Oppose the Latte Tax. Among the members are Seattle's Chamber of Commerce and the city's two largest coffee franchises, Starbucks and Tully's. The tax would force coffeehouses to track sales of any beverage that contains espresso, a task that could be an administrative nightmare for smaller cafes, especially during the frantic morning rush. If espresso counts come under suspicion, coffeehouse owners could face a city audit. University of Chicago economics professor Michael Greenstone said the tax doesn't add up. ""The purpose of any tax is to be efficient and equitable, and this is neither,"" he said. ""On the efficiency side, it's surely going to lead to costly efforts by both businesses and consumers to find ways to avoid the tax. For example, Starbucks could claim that they are using finely ground coffee, [instead of coffee run though an espresso maker] and that consequently, they are exempt from the tax. Would they be right? I don't know, but finding out will surely take lots of legal fees that could have gone to child care. ""Of course, from a public-relations perspective, this is an ingenious idea, and I mean that in a cynical way. They've pitted espresso drinkers against child-care supporters, and who's going to side with the espresso drinkers?"" In fact, the proposed tax has forced opponents into a political two-step, where their criticism must remain a beat behind their public stance of political correctness. In a liberal city like Seattle, corporations continually advertise their commitment to social activism, and throughout the debate over the initiative, JOLT members prefaced their opposition with endorsements of good child care. ""Starbucks will continue to support early-learning and childhood-development programs through the millions of dollars we contribute annually,"" the company said. ""However, Starbucks does not understand why the Economic Opportunity Institute would recommend an additional consumer tax on espresso beverages, or any other single consumer product."" The City Council has yet to decide when the initiative will go before voters next year. The initiative's authors say it is directed at vendors; critics predict it will be passed on to consumers through higher prices, effectively punishing them for their choice of coffee. The tax would be applied to any drink with at least half an ounce of espresso, including decaf. Drip coffee would be exempt. Burbank says the tax would reach only a pre-selected group of consumers who are wealthier than those who drink drip. So, he's been pitching it as a modern-day Robin Hood tax, where the needy get a dime every time the affluent spend $3 to $4 on an espresso. It's the kind of political marketing that Fran Beulah, 43, finds funny. ""I drink espresso,"" she said, laughing, ""and I am not rich.""

Tim Chapman <timc@2ubh.com>,[zzzzteana] And deliver us from weevil,"http://www.guardian.co.uk/climatechange/story/0,12374,806695,00.html Weevil pest warms to life in south-west London James Meek, science correspondent Tuesday October 8, 2002 The Guardian They're chomping in Chelsea, Fulham and Pimlico, but despite their fancy taste in London addresses they are neither posh nor particularly fussy: they are vine weevils and they want to eat your plants. Two species of vine weevil previously unable to survive Britain's cold winters have been discovered in south-west London, and one has also been detected in Surrey, Cardiff and Edinburgh. ""This is probably the most serious new garden pest in recent memory,"" said Max Barclay, the curator of beetles at the Natural History Museum in London who discovered the creatures in the UK. The black vine weevil has long been native to Britain, causing enormous damage to glossy leaved plants such as laurels. But the two new species, otiorhynchus armadillo and otiorhynchus salicicola, not previously known north of Switzerland, are now prevalent in south London. ""It's very likely these weevils have been introduced to Britain through imported ornamental plants from Italy,"" said Dr Barclay. ""It looks like they're here to stay."" He found otiorhynchus armadillo on the window of a Chelsea department store in 1998, but as the shop sold imported house plants, he assumed it was a migrant. It has now quietly become the most common species of vine weevil in south-west London. The second invader is not so numerous, but has established itself firmly in the same area. Apart from laurels, vine weevils attack bay, viburnum, ornamental ivy, and grape vines. An early sign of trouble is that notches appear in leaves. The soil-dwelling larvae bite the roots off below the surface. One possible explanation for the invaders' successful colonisation of Britain is global warming. Earlier springs and milder winters are already a fact. ------------------------ Yahoo!

If it were April Fool's Day, the Net's only official holiday, and you wanted to design a &#8220;novelty format&#8221; to slip by the W3C as a joke, it might look something like RSS 0.9x/2.0: - It would specify limits on data values, then remove them, then specify required elements, then make them optional, thus silently breaking an unknown number of parsers around the world. - It would encourage use of entity-encoded HTML in its most important element, thus ensuring both security risks and unpredictable display for the end user. - It would ignore years of standards work in other fields, committing such egregious sins as defining a guid element that wasn't a GUID, and using an obsolete date format that couldn't easily be sorted by date. - Its primary method of extensibility would be to add new elements to the core namespace without telling anyone or documenting them, thus making it wholely resistant to DTD, schema, or validation of any kind. - After years of worldwide deployment, it would completely reverse its add-whatever-you-want extensibility rules in favor of namespaces, which the spec would neither define nor elaborate on. - After adopting namespaces, it would fail to deprecate any existing elements semantically identical to namespace elements already in wide use. It would also fail to provide precedence rules in cases where a document attempted to say the same thing in two different ways, thus ensuring mass confusion among producers and inconsistent behavior across consumers. RSS 0.9x and 2.0 are the Whoopee Cushion and Joy Buzzer of syndication formats. For anyone who has tried to accomplish anything serious with metadata, it's pretty obvious that of the various implementations of a worldwide syndication format, we have the worst one possible. Except, of course, for all the others. The problem with that list of RSS deficiencies is that it is also a list of necessities&#8212;RSS has flourished in a way that no other syndication format has, not despite many of these qualities but because of them. The very weaknesses that make RSS so infuriating to serious practitioners also make it possible in the first place. - Removing length limitations on description and making title optional opened up RSS to a whole new category of producer: the weblogger. - Allowing encoded HTML in description let publishers reuse both their existing content and the existing RSS infrastructure, without requiring them to produce valid XHTML (which could be embedded directly into an XML document). Social mores, rather than technical rules, prevent producers from intentionally introducing security risks through malicious script tags or unpredictable display through unclosed HTML elements. - Few publishing tools can produce real conforming GUIDs, and it doesn't matter, because virtually all RSS parsers are written in high level languages where handling strings is more efficient than converting strings to bytecodes and handling bytecodes. As for dates, by convention an RSS document is laid out in reverse chronological order, and no one seems to be clamoring for more flexibility. Furthermore, its almost babyish XML syntax, so far from any serious computational framework (Where are the namespaces? Where is the Document Type Description? Why is the aggregators' enforcement of conformity so lax?), made it possible for anyone wanting an RSS feed to write one. The effects of this ease of implementation only become clear when you compare it to the attempts over the years to &#8220;do RSS right&#8221;&#8212;most notably RSS 1.0 in the year 2000. RSS 1.0 had three main benefits: - Backward compatible with RSS 0.90, which was never widely deployed, and which fell into obscurity as soon as (the much simpler) RSS 0.91 was introduced. - Based on RDF (specifically a serialization called RDF/XML), a spec which, at the time and to this day, continues to change or threaten to change. Two years later, there are no major languages or development platforms that ship with parsers to consume RDF, although many (Perl, Python, .NET) have third-party RDF parsers in various states of development and conformance. (The release version is generally out of date; CVS access is recommended. You get the idea.) Meanwhile, RDF/XML production tools are so inconsistent that even RDF experts recommend not using RDF tools to produce an RSS 1.0 feed if you want it to actually be read by any major RSS aggregator. Despite the two-year-old promise of better tools[2], it is now the year 2002, and I built my RSS 1.0 feed&#8212;in the most sophisticated personal publishing system in the world&#8212;by manually typing a mishmash of template tags and angle brackets into a TEXTAREA of an HTML form. - Extensible through namespaces, which, as mentioned above, have been haphazardly and poorly incorporated into RSS 2.0, where they appear to be flourishing. Evolvable formats&#8212;those that proceed by being adapted and extended in a thousand small ways&#8212;have three main characteristics that are germane to their eventual victories over strong, centrally designed formats. - Only solutions that produce partial results with imperfect tools can succeed. My RSS feed is an XML document produced by a template that I built in a TEXTAREA, and consumed by hundreds of parsers around the world that know nothing of XML and hack apart my feed with regular expressions. The world is littered with formats that would have worked if only everyone had better tools. If everyone in the world had a perfect RDF parser at their disposal, it would be trivial to produce and consume all the world's metadata in RDF. Without such perfect tools, both production and consumption instantly become nightmares. There is no middle ground. - What is, is wrong. Because evolvable formats have always been adapted to earlier conditions and are always being further adapted to present conditions, they are always behind the times. RSS was being stretched with long descriptions, optional titles, and entity-encoded HTML even before such practices were codified in the spec, and long before all consumers could handle them. No evolving format is ever perfectly in sync with the challenges it faces. - Finally, Orgel's Rule, named for the evolutionary biologist Leslie Orgel&#8212;&#8220;Evolution is cleverer than you are&#8221;. As with the list of RSS's obvious deficiencies above, it is easy to point out what is wrong with any evolvable system at any point in its life. No one seeing RSS 1.0 and RSS 0.91 side-by-side could doubt that RSS 1.0 had the superior technology, that it &#8220;did things right&#8221;. However, the ability to understand what is missing at any given moment does not mean that one person or a small central group can design a better system in the long haul. Designed formats start out strong and improve logarithmically. Evolvable formats start out weak and improve exponentially. RSS 2.0 is not the perfect syndication format, just the best one that's also currently practical. Infrastructure built on evolvable formats will always be partially incomplete, partially wrong and ultimately better designed than its competition.

No dumping tea in the harbour or anything like that. I think the primary purpose of loud and rowdy protests is to get on television, and that the tactics can be justified as a reaction to a systematic removal of alternative viewpoints from that medium. On the other hand, it was a priceless TV moment. There was nothing resembling assault, and the protestors were not in anybody's face (at least in my understanding of the vernacular). And no, being rude and disrespectful is not the way to influence politicians, but the standard way of using lobbyists and writing checks is beyond many of us. Owen",0

""Reliability"" is more a function of the software engineer. I've written complicated mission-critical server software in Java that will run without a hiccup as long as the Unix box it is sitting on is running. Same with C. For processes that are running months at a time, and in my case constantly touching databases and doing lots of low-level network stuff, reliability is obtained by making sure every conceivable problem (and problems you didn't conceive of) recovers to a clean/safe process state so that things keep running i.e. it is a design/programming issue. That said, we usually prototype serious systems in Java and then re-implement them in C if we have time. Java doesn't scale well as a language for server apps, though not for the reasons usually offered. The problem is that for high-end server apps, you really need fairly detailed and low-level control of system resources to get around bottlenecks that show up relatively quickly in languages that don't give you access to it. You can squeeze several times the performance out of a C server program than a Java one simply by being able to finely tune (or more frequently, bypass) the system resource management. Nonetheless, this is not a significant factor for most applications you could conceivably develop in either language, as most aren't limited by raw performance scalability. -James Rogers jamesr@best.com",0
joelonsoftware <rssfeeds@example.com>,Daniel Berlinger has noticed that Mac software shops are starting to move t,"URL: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/20020910.html Date: Not supplied Daniel Berlinger has noticed[1] that Mac software shops are starting to move to OS X-only development. This makes sense, for two reasons. First, most people who pay for software have new computers. So while OS X may only have a small fraction of the installed base, it has the majority of the population of people who are opening their wallets. Second, if OS X isn't successful, the Mac is _ over_. It's not like System 9 is getting any more popular. Then again, there are very few conditions under which it is actually the right business decision to develop software for the Macintosh. Developing for the Mac is not a whole lot different than creating a web site _that only works on Netscape_. (Given the market share of Macs[2] (about 3.5%) and the market share of Netscape[3] (about 3.4%), that is not a silly comparison.) Robb Beal wrote[4]: ""Try this test. Go to a venture firm, angel, or big company with a Mac OS X product/concept/prototype. Do they consider the fact that it's a Mac application a net plus? (No.)"" Well _duh_. Your product would have to appeal to _25 times more Mac _users_ _[as a percentage] than Windows users just to break even. In other words, if your Windows product appeals to 1 in 100 Windows users, you have to appeal to 25 in 100 Mac users to make the same amount of money. Now, you may want to make an _emotional_ appeal to developing for the Mac. That's fine. If you like Macs and you're doing it for fun, more power to ya. But as long as we're talking _investment_, you have to tell me why you're going to get 25 times as many users. Maybe there's less competition in your category on the Mac; maybe you're in a niche like graphics where it seems like Macs dominate (they don't, it just seems that way because the elite graphics people in big American cities use Macs); maybe your product can't sell to mixed environments unless it runs everywhere. But if you want to make an investment in Mac software be prepared to demonstrate how you're going to overcome that magic 25 multiplier.

James Rogers <jamesr@best.com>,CO2 and climate (was RE: Goodbye Global Warming),"On Mon, 2002-09-23 at 13:53, Jim Whitehead wrote: > > You have not explained why the increase in CO2 concentrations is not > contributing to increasing global temperature. There are a number of reasons to think that CO2 is not important to controlling global temperature and that much of the CO2 increase may not be anthropogenic. Some recent research points worth mentioning: Recent high-resolution studies of historical CO2 concentrations and temperatures over hundreds of thousands of years have shown a modest correlation between the two. In a number of cases, CO2 level increases are not in phase with temperature increases and actually trail the increase in temperature by a short time i.e. increases in temperature preceded increases in CO2 concentrations. The more studies that are done of the geological record, the more it seems that CO2 concentrations are correlated with temperature increases, but are not significantly causative. There is a lot of evidence that CO2 levels are regulated in a fairly stable fashion. I don't believe anyone really has an authoritative answer as to exactly how this works yet. With respect to absolute CO2 concentrations, it is also important to point out that our best data to date suggests that they follow a fairly regular cycle with a period of about 100,000 years. At previous cycle peaks, the concentrations were similar to what they are now. If this cycle has any validity (and we only have good data for 4-5 complete cyclical periods, but which look surprisingly regular in shape and time), then we should be almost exactly at a peak right now. As it happens, current CO2 concentrations are within 10% of other previous cyclical concentration peaks for which we have good data. In other words, we may be adding to the CO2 levels, but it looks a lot like we would be building a molehill on top of a mountain in the historical record. At the very least, there is nothing anomalous about current CO2 concentrations. Also, CO2 levels interact with the biosphere in a manner that ultimately affects temperature. Again, the interaction is not entirely predictable, but this is believed to be one of the regulating negative feedback systems mentioned above. Last, as greenhouse gases go, CO2 isn't particularly potent, although it makes up for it in volume in some cases. Gases such as water and methane have a far greater impact as greenhouse gases on a per molecule basis. Water vapor may actually be the key greenhouse gas, something that CO2 only indirectly effects through its interaction with the biosphere. CO2 was an easy mark for early environmentalism, but all the recent studies and data I've seen gives me the impression that it is largely a passenger on the climate ride rather than the driver. I certainly don't think it is a healthy fixation if we're actually interested in understanding warming trends. Cheers, -James Rogers jamesr@best.com",0

""We sold 26,000 Twinkies in 18 days. People drove for hours just to taste our Twinkie,"" said Rocky Mullen, who sells the deep-fried, cream-filled treats for $3 (U.S.) each at the Payallup Fair, 50 kilometres south of Seattle. As if Twinkies are not sweet enough already, vendors such as Mr. Mullen add chocolate or berry sauce and sprinkle powdered sugar on top... Hearing about Mr. Sell's invention, Hostess, the company that makes the 71-year-old snack, started promoting deep-fried Twinkies to state and county fairs, where a captive population of junk-food addicts began gobbling them up between pig races and tractor-pull competitions. How bad are they for your health? After deep-frying, a Twinkie packs an estimated 400 calories and 28 grams of fat.

I don't think gpg signing my repositories will help anything, as it will just ensure that my passphrase was typed to confirm the md5 signatures of all pgklists and srclists. Basically, you'll then just be sure that it's me who generated the files, and this will of course prevent automating the process of updating the apt repository when Red Hat updates show up. In Red Hat Linux 8.0 though, the warnings about ""No Key"" appear until you import the right gpg public keys directly with rpm, for example : rpm --import /usr/share/doc/apt-0.5.4cnc7/RPM-GPG-KEY (this will import my key, which is used to sign all freshrpms.net packages) Hopefully it is possible to the tell rpm to install *only* packages who verify against an imported gpg key?

It doesn't look too hard. Not to beat a dead horse, but that's exactly what my spamcan package did. For those just tuning in, spamcan is a thingy I wrote before I knew about Tim & co's work on this crazy stuff; you can download it from <http://woozle.org/~neale/src/spamcan/spamcan.html>, but I'm not going to work on it anymore. I'm currently writing a new one based on classifier (and timtest's booty-kicking tokenizer). I'll probably have something soon, like maybe half an hour, and no, it's not too hard. The hard part is storing the data somewhere. I don't want to use ZODB, as I'd like something a person can just drop in with a default Python install. So anydbm is looking like my best option. I already have a setup like this using Xavier Leroy's SpamOracle, which does the same sort of thing. You call it from procmail, it adds a new header, and then you can filter on that header. Really easy. Here's how I envision this working. Everybody gets four new mailboxes: train-eggs train-spam trained-eggs trained-spam You copy all your spam and eggs* into the ""train-"" boxes as you get it. How frequently you do this would be up to you, but you'd get better results if you did it more often, and you'd be wise to always copy over anything which was misclassified. Then, every night, the spam fairy swoops down and reads through your folders, learning about what sorts of things you think are eggs and what sorts of things are spam. After she's done, she moves your mail into the ""trained-"" folders. This would work for anybody using IMAP on a Unix box, or folks who read their mail right off the server. I've spoken with some fellows at work about Exchange and they seem to beleive that Exchange exports appropriate functionality to implement a spam fairy as well. Advanced users could stay ahead of the game by reprogramming their mail client to bind the key ""S"" to ""move to train-spam"" and ""H"" to ""move to train-eggs"". Eventually, if enough people used this sort of thing, it'd start showing up in mail clients. That's the ""delete as spam"" button Paul Graham was talking about. * The Hormel company might not think well of using the word ""ham"" as the opposite of ""spam"", and they've been amazingly cool about the use of their product name for things thus far. So I propose we start calling non-spam something more innocuous (and more Monty Pythonic) such as ""eggs"". Neale",0

Just to solve this...the reason I was booting the box with root=/dev/hda5, not /dev/md0 was because /dev/md0 wasn't booting - it would barf with 'can't find init'. It turns out that this is because I was populating md0 with tar. Which seems to have 'issues' with crosslinked files - for instance, it was trying to make a hard link of glibc.so to hda - and failing. It was only as I did it again with a friend present, that he spotted the errors, and queried them. We noticed that the hard linked files just didn't exist on the new rootfs. When we duplicated the filesystems with dump instead of tar, it worked fine, I was able to tell lilo to use root=/dev/md0 and everything worked. Woohoo.

Yes ;) first off, redhat does not support upgrading from beta's to the released version. That doesn't mean it can't work, it means nobody tried it, they sure didn't test it or fix anything to make it work, and you're on your own. second, historically a new .0 numbers mostly means ""so much has been changed that you might have problems upgrading from any previous release anyway"".

Tim Chapman <timc@2ubh.com>,[zzzzteana] Hot rock,"http://yorkshirepost.co.uk/scripts/editorial2.cgi?cid=news&aid=481620 Close encounter of burnt kind IT came from outer space  or did it? Teenager Siobhan Cowton is convinced the object which struck her as she climbed into the family car at her home in Northallerton is extra-terrestrial. But while her claims are being treated with a certain amount of studied academic scepticism by experts in these matters, the 14-year-old schoolgirl is adamant she was hit on the foot by a meteorite. Siobhan initially thought there was a more prosaic explanation  that the odd-looking stone had been thrown at her by a child,. But on closer inspection, she discovered all was not as it seemed  because it was hot when she picked it up. It hit her on a foot but caused no injury. ""I looked at it again and it had a black and grey colour with a shiny bubble surface,"" she said. After closer inspection by her father Niel, and comparison with pictures on the Internet, Siobhan plans to ask scientists at Durham University to check the object for authenticity. If it is from outer space, Siobhan says she will consider putting it up for auction. She added: ""If it isn't worth anything then I suppose I will keep it myself for sentimental value. It is not every day that you are hit by a meteorite."" But Dr Ben Horton, a lecturer in physical geography, was the acme of academic caution. ""Meteors have features that can be used to establish whether it is a piece of extraterrestrial rock,"" he said. ""They have a very smooth surface but sometimes they have shallow depressions and cavities. If they are hot, they should have a black ash like crust burnt around the edge. ""Most are between five and 60 centimetres but five centimetres is the smallest that they usually appear."" To establish the provenance of Siobhan's suspected meteorite it would have to be subject to a mineral breakdown but Dr Horton thinks the chances of it being extra-terrestrial are slim. ""Around 50,000 a year strike the Earth's surface and, considering the size of the Earth, it is very unlikely to be a meteorite. ""However, there is a possibility and there is no reason it couldn't happen,"" he added. ------------------------ Yahoo!

This make me wonder about the relative protection of smart cards. They have an internal procession unit around 4MHz. Can we consider them as trusted hardware ? The ability to ship smart cards periodicaly uppon cashing of a monthly subscription fee would not raise too much the cost of ""renting"" the system. Smart card do their own self encryption. Can they be used to decrypt data needed by the system ? The input of the system could me mangled and the would keep a reference of how long it was in service.

But RAM is expensive, and the directory structures of many systems (e.g. Windows) are not sufficiently organized and standardized to make this combination of bootable CDs and RAM drives practical. Even if you are fortunate enough to be using Linux (or another FHS-compliant *nix), you still can't fit a lot on a CD. Its not unusual today to have gigabytes of static multimedia content on the web server. This particular problem can be alleviated somewhat by using DVDs, but this is a temporary solution at best which will become outdated quickly as our data requirements grow and hard drives become cheaper. >> Obviously, you can't do this with partitions that accrue important >> state, e.g. a partition that stores database table data. >... but if you *do* want some state to persist, then you need a >mountable writable partition. To protect it, you need some kind of >access control management to decide who can do what to the writable >partition, blah blah blah ... and before you know it, the security >problem starts to look just like it does for conventional servers. Right. This is why you would consolidate all state of any long-term significance on just a couple partitions, and why you would not put static application code on these changeable partitions. Fortunately, most large client/server application physical architectures do this anyhow, because these are two fundamentally different kinds of state with two very different sets of administrative, security, RAID, and backup requirements. People also tend to do this anyhow because layered logical architectures are popular with the GUI at one end, business logic in the middle, and persistence services at the other. This logical architecture maps naturally to a physical architecture that has a static web server, a static application server, and a database server that has static and changeable partitions. (I use the word static versus changeable instead of writeable versus unwritable because the ""unchangeable"" partitions might be written to for temporary swap space. Who knows what Windows does internally?) My point is that there should be a market out there for a hardware RAID device that can split designated partitions into a permanent base image partition and a temporary delta image partition, that has some simple but solid security measures to prevent the unauthorized remote modification of base images, and that can be configured to clear the delta image when the server is rebooted. If some vendor wished to implement this, they could then market this as a mechanism to help frustrate broad classes of attack that rely on the permanent modification of system or application files via buffer overflows, platform and middleware bugs, etc. The prevention of unauthorized modification of application data, of course, would not be addressed by this particular product. But there are many other techniques out there to defend application data. But those techniques all assume that your system itself has not been compromised at a lower level, which is where this product could help. I would have to think that these features would be relatively easy for a hardware RAID vendor to implement. (I'm just guessing, of course, with no knowledge of how hardware RAID works internally.) If anyone knows of such a product, I'd love to hear about it. Ben",0

I think the ability to maintain an inconsistent database is key to decentralization. Databases enforce consistenty with every transaction. Bounded transactions, like an ATM, enforce consistency by have some play with time and value Most people keep inconsistent data in their heads, it's called congnitive dissonance theory Most businesses keep inconsistent data, documents, tationale and ideas to support their work activities, it's called real life. I don't think it matters so much where it's located, i.e. decentralization. I think that decentralization is the workaround from technical limitations. The fallout being that the only way inconsistent information spaces can be maintained is by protecting them through a set of trust barriers and boundaries. The local information when combined with the technical troubles of providing ""just enough"" forced synchronization to remote information provide workable data consistenty, i.e. enforcing local constraints or ignoring global ones when concerns are more immedidate. Tolerating temporary, irreconcilable deviations is how people cope, otherwise you'd be like Nick Gatsby unnecessarily pre-occupied with a spot of shaving cream on McKee's neck who thinks that if he can just wipe that spot off that the whole world would be a little more perfect and everything, including his pre-occupation with Daisy, would consistently be in its proper place.

"""R. A. Hettinga"" <rah@shipwright.com>",The Disappearing Alliance,"http://www.techcentralstation.com/1051/printer.jsp?CID=1051-100802B The Disappearing Alliance By Dale Franks 10/08/2002 For over two generations, the countries of Western Europe have been our closest allies. We stood beside each other through the darkest days of the Cold War as partners in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. We celebrated with them over the fall of the Soviet Empire and the liberation of Eastern Europe from the yoke of communism. Tragically, a generation from now, we may be bitter adversaries. Europe has increasingly fallen under the spell of a political ideology that Hudson Institute scholar John Fonte has termed ""progressive transnationalism"". The key doctrines of this form of post-communist progressivism contain some fairly pernicious ideas. Among these are the deconstruction of nationalism, the promotion of post-nationalist ideas of citizenship (i.e. a ""global"" citizenry), a redefinition of democracy, and the pooling of national sovereignty into multinational groups such as the United Nations. The European Union, itself a multinational organization built through the pooling of sovereignty by European nations, is post-democratic. While there is a European Parliament, the EU's power resides mainly in the unelected European Commission (EC) and its unelected President, who face few limits to their power. Instead of a limited, consensual form of government, where elected representatives promulgate constitutional laws, the EU has an appointed, oligarchic executive, along with a large attendant bureaucracy, whose orders are not constitutionally limited in any real sense. Moreover, the EU has been unwilling to accept the democratically expressed wishes of the people themselves when those wishes conflict with the results desired by the EU's political elite. Both the EC and the European Court of Justice regularly overturn the national laws of democratically elected EU member governments. This is a step backward in Europe's political development. European criticism of America is on the rise, and the European list of complaints about America is a long and growing one. They dislike the fact that our republican system of government is not based on proportional representation. They hate the fact that our citizens own guns. They despise the fact that we execute murderers. They resent the fact that our economy is so large, and that Americans consume so much. They also resent?and fear - the fact that we have the ability to project American power anywhere in the world.",0

Police Ire Sat Sep 21, 3:37 PM ET WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An online ""anarchist scavenger hunt"" proposed for next week's annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund ( news - web sites) and World Bank ( news - web sites) here has raised the ire of police, who fear demonstrators could damage property and wreak havoc. Break a McDonald's window, get 300 points. Puncture a Washington D.C. police car tire to win 75 points. Score 400 points for a pie in the face of a corporate executive or World Bank delegate. D.C. Assistant Police Chief Terrance Gainer told a congressional hearing on Friday that law authorities were in talks to decide whether planned protests were, ""so deleterious to security efforts that we ought to take proactive action."" Several thousand people are expected to demonstrate outside the IMF and World Bank headquarters next weekend. The Anti-Capitalist Convergence, a D.C.-based anarchist group, is also planning a day-long traffic blockade, banner-drops and protests against major corporations in the downtown core. Chuck, the 37 year-old webmaster of the anarchist site www.infoshop.org who declined to give his last name, told Reuters his scavenger hunt was meant as a joke. ""People were asking for things to do when they come to D.C. We made the list to get people thinking, so they don't do the boring, standard stuff,"" he said.

"""hyatt@mozilla"" <rssfeeds@example.com>",More fun with the PTC,"URL: http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/#85378428 Date: Not supplied I received some feedback in email (from several of you actually) regarding my earlier blog about the Parents Television Council[1], which recently published a report in which they labeled Buffy as the worst show on television for children. Let me clarify why this organization bothers me so much. Buffy as a show is clearly inappropriate for children under 12, and a game like GTA3 is as well. The PTC, however, has a clear agenda that goes beyond simply warning parents about the dangers of television shows or video games. There is a belief on the part of the PTC that the hour from 8-9pm (the first hour of primetime) must be designated a family hour, and that no offensive shows should air during that time. I don't believe that it's the networks' responsibility to restrict the kind of content aired during a particular hour of television. The shows that air during primetime run the gamut; some are family-oriented and some aren't. There is, however, no shortage of suitable content should parents and children wish to watch TV together during this hour. It should be the parent's responsibility to police a child's television viewing. If you don't want your kids watching _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_, then don't let them, but don't campaign to have the show removed from the air or shoved into a late hour that would only result in its cancellation just because you don't like its content. If you don't think a show is appropriate, don't let your kids watch it. The PTC also seems to find shows offensive that are family-oriented. An example of one such show is _Malcolm in the Middle_. I would hardly call this show inappropriate for kids. Apparently the only shows that the PTC deems appropriate are those that have been sanitized to match their ultra-conservative agenda. Even then, I wouldn't really mind, but the idea that all other shows must be relegated to some later hour is just ludicrous. [1] http://www.parentstv.org/",0

This release contains early java libraries and documentation that would primarily be of interest to developers. Talking about documentation, it is still a bit slim and mainly oriented towards people with experience in Java/XML development. There are currently no sample applications, but they will be available in the next release. The framework currently contains the following: - Classes for creating ""Named Objects"", which are authenticated using digital signatures within a hierarchy. - Storage framework for ""Named Objects"". - Simple XML-Signature implementation (Almost certainly not yet interoperable with other implementations) - Simple SOAP client - Simple Servlet API for handling SOAP requests based on ""Named Objects"". - Current types of ""Named Objects"" include: NameSpace objects -- for maintaining the NameSpace Authentication Framework AuthenticationTickets -- for doing web site authentication using digital signatures. Next major release is scheduled to contain: - Core: hard coded root public key, for authenticating top level NameSpaces - Signing Services: Implementation of web based signing services End user hosted signing service - Example User Authentication Application - Example Payment System based on NeuDist I will be expanding the documentation over the next few weeks. This will cover not only more indepth technical documentation, but also higher level documentation about the business side of things.

For various reasons none of the commercial setup toolkits (Wise, InstallShield, Windows Installer) could do even 25% of what our setup program needed to do, so I ended up writing it from scratch. VC++ and MFC all the way. It took longer than I expected because I had this weird conviction that the entire setup process should be completely reversable, and as you go backwards through the wizard it should automatically and silently undo any changes it had already made. So even if you're looking at the last screen, if you decide you want to change where to extract the files, you can just back up and change it and everything moves and all the old files you overwrote are put back and all the Windows accounts you created are uncreated and all the permissions we granted are ungranted and the SQL database you made is unmade and so on. The end result is a great setup program, but it may be a tad overkill. If I have time I'll write more about what I learned. One benefit of writing a setup program from scratch is that I don't have to have someone else's stupid cartoon-of-a-computer-and-floppy-disks in the upper right hand corner. I used a photograph of the London Skyline, currently infested with cranes. I took the picture from the cafe at the Tate Modern.

tim.one@comcast.net,[Spambayes] testing results,"Neil trained a classifier using 3 sets with about 500 ham and spam in each. We're missing half his test run results due to a cmp.py bug (since fixed); the ""before custom fiddling"" figures on the 3 reported runs were: false positive percentages 0.187 0.749 0.780 total unique fp 19 false negative percentages 2.072 2.448 0.574 total unique fn 43 The ""total unique"" figures counts all 6 runs; it's just the individual-run fp and fn percentages we're missing for 3 runs. Jeremy reported these ""before custom fiddling"" figures on 4 sets with about 600 ham and spam in each: false positive percentages 0.000 1.398 1.398 0.000 1.242 1.242 1.398 1.398 0.000 1.553 1.553 0.000 total unique fp 139 false negative percentages 10.413 6.104 5.027 8.259 2.873 5.745 5.206 4.488 9.336 5.206 5.027 9.874 total unique fn 970 So things are clearly working much better for Neil. Both reported significant improvements in both f-n and f-p rates by folding in more header lines. Neal added Received analysis to the base tokenizer's header analysis, and Jeremy skipped the base tokenizer's header analysis completely but added base-subject-line-like but case-folded tokenization for almost all header lines (excepting only Received, Data, X-From_, and, I *suspect*, all those starting with 'x-vm'). When I try 5 random pairs of 500-ham + 500-spam subsets in my test data, I see: false positive percentages 0.000 0.000 0.200 0.000 0.200 0.000 0.200 0.000 0.000 0.200 0.400 0.000 0.200 0.000 0.200 0.400 0.000 0.400 0.200 0.600 total unique fp 10 false negative percentages 0.800 0.400 0.200 0.600 1.000 0.000 0.600 1.200 1.200 0.800 0.400 0.800 1.800 0.800 0.400 1.000 1.000 0.400 0.000 0.600 total unique fn 36 This is much closer to what Neil saw, but still looks better. Another run on a disjoint 5 random pairs looked much the same; total unique fp rose to 12 and fn fell to 27; on a third run with another set of disjoint 5 random pairs, likewise, with fp 12 and fn 40. So I'm pretty confident that it's not going to matter which random subsets of 500 I take from my data. It's hard to conclude anything given Jeremy's much worse results. If they were in line with Neil's results, I'd suspect that I've over-tuned the algorithm to statistical quirks in my corpora.",0

And further, why focus on the fact they were laid off and not on the fact they were hired in the first place? BTW: I saw someone claim that aside from the efficiency of the market there were also gains to society from irrational behavior. If a society has business people that systematically overestimate their chances, that is bad for the businessmen but on net a big gain for society. On the social level, the law of averages works to societies benefit in a manner it can't for an individual. A key reason, in this view, that the US wound up outperforming England was that the English investors were too rational for their societies own good.

Although my fingerprints are all over that, it's not actually my code and has been in there since before 1998. (It's code that I moved from mh.tcl to sequences.tcl and back again). I'm no5 sure either, but it should be a one-time penalty because the sequence will be re-written with the bad messages removed.

That *was* a problem, but if you look at Mh_Sequence (and Mh_Sequences and Mh_SequenceUpdate), they all call MhReadSeqs to do the actual reading and it only reads the sequences if the file has been touched. Look for the ""Exmh_Debug Reading $filename"" output in the debug log to see when sequences are actually reread from disk. My theory is that Ftoc_ShowSequences is being called too often.

In my experience, this protest behavior is really only an issue in ""ultra-liberal"" coastal cities, which is where I normally live. It is part of the culture and that behavior is viewed as acceptable. For comparison, contrast this with the character of the arguably more serious protests against Federal government abuse in the inter-mountain West. They have a very different idea of what constitutes acceptable protest practice. Those protests remain largely civil and polite, if heated and aggressive, and those involve a far greater percentage of the local population. And unlike 99% of the liberal coastal city protests I've seen, the people protesting in the inter-mountain West are actually facing immediate dire consequences from the activities they are protesting and are strongly motivated to protest in a manner that gets results. Some of their tactics, such as the practice of many businesses and restaurants in northern Nevada to not give service to anyone known to be in the employ of the BLM and related agencies, have been very effective at forcing dialog. I don't recall anyone characterizing their protests as impolite, rude, or violent, but then they have more to lose. -James Rogers jamesr@best.com",0

Tom <tomwhore@slack.net>,Kill Your Gods,"Hindus mourn 'monkey god' By Omer Farooq BBC reporter in Hyderabad Hundreds of people have attended the funeral of a monkey which became revered as a divine incarnation of a Hindu god in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. The monkey was quite old and both its hind legs were paralysed Animal rights campaigners say the monkey died of starvation and exhaustion after being trapped in a temple for a month by over-zealous worshippers. The animal was cremated in Anantapur district, 400 kilometres (250 miles) south of the state capital, Hyderabad, on Sunday. It had not eaten for three weeks. Last rites were performed by priests in the village of Timmiganipally in the presence of hundreds of devotees who had come to believe that the monkey was a reincarnation of the Hindu monkey god, Hanuman. Garlanded One animal rights activist said his group's efforts to save the monkey had failed because of the blind faith of the people. The monkey's death came a day after he and others tried to move the animal out of the temple, but were prevented by villagers. The monkey, which was found perched on top of an idol of Hanuman a month ago, attracted hundreds of devotees every day from surrounding villages, as well as from the neighbouring state of Karnataka. Devotees showered the monkey with fruit and flowers and worshipped it around the clock. 'Exploited' Locals said they believed that Lord Hanuman was visiting the village, as the temple had stopped daily rituals after a dispute between two groups of residents. But animal rights campaigners complained that the animal was being mistreated. They filed a petition in the state's High Court saying the monkey had been forcibly confined in the temple. The group also alleged that people's religious feelings were being exploited to make money. The court then ordered the local administration to rescue the monkey - but villagers prevented officials from taking him for treatment in time.",0

Unfortunately, these countries lack strong usability traditions and their developers have limited access -- if any -- to good usability data from the target users."" Offshore usability is a specific case of the general ""offshore design"" problem. Put simply, software teams are not successful when design or management are done in a different physical location than programming. Once I actually had a job where I was in New York, my direct manager was in Singapore, _his_ manager was in Hyderabad, and if I needed any management input I had literally no choice but to go to the CEO because at least he was awake during the same hours as I was. You can't get things done like this. A good project team relies on hundreds of small interactions a day. Here in the Fog Creek offices, we have 10 small conversations about FogBUGZ 3.0 development every day. What I don't understand is people who think it's OK to move the developers ten time zones away from their managers and expect good results. Those same people would scream bloody murder if you told them that you were going to send the whole _management_ team to Bangalore or Beijing. [1] http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20020916.html",0

Their front-line customer service sucks, but the prices and network can't be beat. T-Mobile is in the midst of a massive makeover. In recent months, the company changed its name and launched an ad campaign featuring Ms. Zeta Jones. The company has a history worth hiding. T-Mobile, a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom, is known for having a weak national network, and the FCC received 1,466 complaints about the company in the past year, giving it one of the worst complaint rates in the industry. T-Mobile says their complaint rate has tapered off and that they have made substantial network improvements.

Do a wget of a file of known length, in a script that runs ""date"" before and after (or equivalent). Be aware that speed between you and your upstream link is one thing; speed through countless congested routers to a faraway location may be quite another. Remember that hardware-level compression is a factor. (The file you wget will probably be precompressed.) In the area of the slightly more exotic, be aware that different traffic may have higher priority and thus more available bandwidth at various points in the transit to/from you -- and that some traffic may go via different paths coming vs. going. Be aware that raw bulk transfer speed may not be the only thing that matters: Depending on what you're doing, the modem's connection latency might matter, and this differs widely between modems. (It matters more for interactive sessions, e.g., ssh remote logins, where each keystroke is echoed from remote.) -- Cheers, ""Send a policeman, and have it arrested.""

I say half-hearted because I'm still application-centric, and I don't go as far with keyboard shortcuts as I could. But I don't use the desktop at all (never have, on any system), and I don't use ctrl alt keyboard shortcuts because I personally find them awkward (YMMV). If you must use Windows, the first step towards a productive system is managing your Start menu. I use the main level of the Start menu with numbered shortcuts to my most common programs. ""0 Control Panel[3]"", ""1 Mozilla[4]"", ""2 Emacs[5]"", ""3 DOS home"", ""4 DOS work"", ""5 DOS incoming"" (each of which gives me a command line, but in different directories), ""7 Python[6]"", ""9 IE"". Also ""# Explorer home"", ""$ Explorer work"", ""% Explorer incoming"", which open Explorer windows in various useful directories (the same directories as the DOS shortcuts, only with the shift key held down, and yes, I intentionally set it up so that $ went to my work folder). Less-used programs are taken out of their useless submenus (as installed) and moved directly into the Programs submenu and given unique first letters as needed. ""Ad-aware[7]"", ""Excel[8]"", ""IM"", ""Netscape 4[9]"", ""Paint Shop Pro"", ""Query Tool (ODBC)[10]"", ""VMWare[11]"", ""Word[12]"". All other submenus except Startup are removed from the Programs menu. (Yes, delete ""Accessories"". Do you honestly ever use it? If so, it's probably a sign of a larger productivity problem.) Things which never need to be run manually (like WinZip and Quicktime) are removed from the Programs menu. Maintaining a clean Programs menu is an ongoing struggle, but well worth it.",0

Eugen Leitl <eugen@leitl.org>,Making a mesh on the move,"http://www.guardian.co.uk/Print/0%2c3858%2c4489999%2c00.html Making a mesh on the move A new way to give us fast mobile net access spells further trouble for 3G, reports Peter Rojas Peter Rojas Thursday August 29, 2002 The Guardian Imagine being able to surf the net at speeds faster than DSL from anywhere, at any time - you could watch a live video webcast while waiting for the bus, email photos to your friends while sitting in the park, or download the MP3 of the song that's playing in the pub before it finishes. This is the vision of a high-speed wireless internet paradise that the third-generation (3G) mobile phone companies have been promoting for years. 3G services are just beginning to be rolled out, but a new technology called mesh networking promises to deliver on this vision sooner and more effectively than the mobile phone companies could ever dream. Two companies, US startup MeshNetworks and Moteran Networks of Germany, are each developing their own competing version of mesh networking. Instead of the current hub-and-spoke model of wireless communications, with every device connecting to an overburdened central antenna, any time ""mesh-enabled"" devices - mobile phones, PDAs, laptops - are in close proximity to each other, they automatically create a wireless mesh network. Every device in the area acts as a repeater or router, relaying traffic for everyone else. Traffic hops from person to person until it reaches the nearest internet access point, reducing the need for central antennas, and improving wireless coverage. As the number of mobile phones soars, and wireless PDAs, laptops, and other devices begin to crowd the spectrum, this approach to wireless networking may be inevitable. Mesh networks also have several other advantages over 3G wireless networks. While 3G operators roll out mobile services that offer users connection speeds of up to 144 kbps (roughly three times faster than a dial-up modem), Moteran and MeshNetworks are able to offer connection speeds of up to 6Mbps, over a hundred times faster than dial-up. The technologies they use include Wi-Fi - the emerging standard for high-speed wireless networking also known as 802.11b. A similarly short-range protocol called UltraWideBand, which is poised to succeed Wi-Fi, is even faster and could, by 2005, approach 400 Mbps. The range of a typical Wi-Fi network is generally too limited to be of much use when travelling around a city. Mesh networks get around the problem of coverage by having every device in the network relay traffic. Even though the range of any individual device is relatively small, because (in theory) there will be so many users in the surrounding area, connections will be faster and better than that of a standard 3G wireless connection. Because mesh networks use Wi-Fi, the equipment and infrastructure needed to create them is cheap and readily available. Instead of building cellular phone towers that often cost hundreds of thousands of pounds, all that is needed to get a network going are wireless access points (around £100 now) placed strategically around town to relay traffic, and the proper software. Existing laptops and PDAs can be mesh-enabled by software. It also means that anyone could set up their own mobile phone network. Unlike with 3G cellular, the part of the spectrum that Wi-Fi operates on is unregulated in the US, Britain. The mobile phone companies are none too pleased about this, especially since many of them spent billions of pounds acquiring 3G licences. All that's needed are cheap relays and mobile phones equipped to connect to the network. With every additional customer that signs up coverage gets better, instead of getting worse, as is the case with mobile phone networks. But things get very interesting when you realise that when you have high-speed internet connections everywhere, and everyone's laptops, PDAs, and mobile phones are connected together at blazingly fast speeds, sharing music, movies, or whatever else becomes ridiculously easy. When UltraWideBand hits, all of this will just accelerate. At 400Mbps, copying a pirated copy of the Lord of the Rings from the person sitting across from you at the cafe would take about 15 seconds. Sooner or later, playgrounds will be filled with kids swapping files of their favourite songs, movies, and video games. But the first mesh networks are not likely to be available to consumers. MeshNetworks has no plans to offer its own high-speed wireless service. Instead the company plans to sell its technology to others, such as cities that want to provide wireless internet to police, fire, and public works employees, or businesses that want to establish wireless networks on the cheap. Moteran has similar aspirations for small businesses and for enterprise networks. The first place average users may use the technology is when it is incorporated into vehicles, enabling motorists to access the internet at high speeds, which both companies see happening soon. When will you be able to wander around town with a 6Mbps connection in your pocket? It's too soon to say, but just as broadband internet service was initially available only to businesses and universities, eventually someone will see the profit in bringing mesh networking to the masses.",0

Based on the Vostok data, you are right, there is a very strong correlation between temperature and CO2 concentrations, but it doesn't always appear to be causal. > With respect to absolute CO2 concentrations, it is also important to > point out that our best data to date suggests that they follow a fairly > regular cycle with a period of about 100,000 years. Also correct -- the peak of each cycle is at about 290-300 ppm CO2. > As it > happens, current CO2 concentrations are within 10% of other previous > cyclical concentration peaks for which we have good data. Not correct. Mauna Loa data <http://www.grida.no/climate/vital/06.htm> and <http://cdiac.ornl.gov/ftp/ndp001/maunaloa.co2> show that the current CO2 concentrations are at 370ppm, 18% *greater* than the *highest* recorded value from the past 400k years. Furthermore, CO2 concentrations are growing at 15ppm every 10 years, much faster than any recorded increase in the Vostok data (though perhaps the Vostok data isn't capable of such fine resolution). > In other words, we may be adding to the CO2 levels, No, we are *definitely* adding to CO2 levels. Look at the following chart: http://www.grida.no/climate/vital/07.htm (Shows CO2 concentrations since 1870, the ""historical record""). Not only is the CO2 increase over 130 years unprecedented in the Vostok record, it is clear that the rate of change is *increasing*, not decreasing. There is no other compelling explanation for this increase, except for anthropogenic input. You're really out on the fringe if you're debating this -- even global warming skeptics generally concede this point. > but it looks a lot like we > would be building a molehill on top of a mountain in the historical > record. At the very least, there is nothing anomalous about current CO2 > concentrations. Wrong again. Current CO2 levels are currently unprecedented over the past 400k years, unless there is some mechanism that allows CO2 levels to quickly spike, and then return back to ""normal"" background levels (and hence the spike might not show up in the ice cores). Still, by around 2075-2100 we will have reached 500 ppm CO2, a level that even you would have a hard time arguing away. > Also, CO2 levels interact with the biosphere in a manner that ultimately > affects temperature.

Still, we know ocean water has a finite capacity to store CO2, and if the world temperature doesn't increase, but we all have Seattle-like weather all the time, the effects would be enormous. > Last, as greenhouse gases go, CO2 isn't particularly potent, although it > makes up for it in volume in some cases.

Data on relative contributions of greenhouse gasses: http://www.grida.no/climate/vital/05.htm Note that methane concentrations now are *much* higher than pre-industrial levels (many cows farting, and rice paddies outgassing), and methane is also a contributor in the formation of atmospheric water vapor. Another clearly anthropogenic increase in a greenhouse gas. I'm in favor of reductions in methane levels as well.

I tend to think that holistic, and techical approaches would work best in reducing global warming. I favor an energy policy that has a mix of solar, wind and nuclear, with all carbon-based combustion using renewable sources of C-H bonds. Aggressive pursuit of carbon sink strategies also makes sense (burying trees deep underground, for example). Approaches that involve reductions in lifestyle to a ""sustainable"" level are unrealistic -- Americans just won't do it (you'd be surprised at the number of climate change researchers driving SUVs). But, as California showed during last year's energy crisis, shifts in patterns of consumption are possible, and improved efficiency is an easy sell. - Jim",0

That's just apt's way of telling you the package is in ""AllowDuplicated"", meaning multiple versions of the package can be installed at the same time. Yes the output is a bit strange.. especially when there's only one version available.

Schemes that remain ignorant of MIME are vulnerable to spammers putting arbitrary amounts of ""nice text"" in the preamble area (after the headers and before the first MIME section), which most mail readers don't display, but which appear first in the file so are latched on to by Graham's scoring scheme. But I don't worry about clever spammers -- I've seen no evidence that they exist <0.5 wink>. Even if they do, the Open Source zoo is such that no particular scheme will gain dominance, and there's no percentage for spammers in trying to fool just one scheme. Even if they did, for the kind of scheme we're using here they can't *know* what ""nice text"" is, not unless they pay a lot of attention to the spam targets and highly tailor their messages to each different one. At that point they'd be doing targeted marketing, and the cost of the game to them would increase enormously. if-you're-out-to-make-a-quick-buck-you-don't-waste-a-second-on-hard- targets-ly y'rs - tim",0

Tom <tomwhore@slack.net>,The GOv gets tough on Net Users.....er Pirates..,"from http://www.arstechnica.com/ ""There has mostly been talk thus far and little action, but the Department of Justice says it may be ready to file criminal lawsuits against individuals [1] who distribute or receive unauthorized copyrighted material over the Internet. Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Malcolm believes that ""criminal prosecutions of copyright offenders are now necessary to preserve the viability of America's content industries."" Malcolm also believes that people who trade copyrighted material think they are participating in a legal activity. I certainly think people who download copyrighted works understand that such distribution--barring provisions such as fair use--is not authorized, and it is not surprising to see businesses continue to look for means to discourage distribution of copyrighted works. ""Some prosecutions that make that clear could be very helpful...I think they would think twice if they thought there was a risk of criminal prosecution,"" said [RIAA President Cary] Sherman, who was on the same conference panel. I'm not too confident that lawsuits would have the effect Sherman is hoping for. Although infrequent, there have already been civil suits or warnings issued to private individuals, and they have served as minor deterrents to the file-sharing community at large. Criminal lawsuits carrying with them the possibility of prison sentences may generate further animosity against groups such as the RIAA and may be difficult to initiate because of the ""schooling"" effect of millions of systems participating in file sharing. Only servers would seem to stand out from the crowd. The article cites the No Electronic Theft (NET) Act [2], which defines illegal activity and maximum penalties for copyright infringement: Criminal infringement: Any person who infringes a copyright willfully for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain, or by the reproduction or distribution, including by electronic means, during any 180-day period, of 1 or more copies or phonorecords of 1 or more copyrighted works, which have a total retail value of more than $1,000.... For purposes of this subsection, evidence of reproduction or distribution of a copyrighted work, by itself, shall not be sufficient to establish willful infringement. ... The term ""financial gain"" includes receipt, or expectation of receipt, of anything of value, including the receipt of other copyrighted works. Therefore, receipt of a work of value would be defined as ""financial gain"" even if no money is involved. The NET Act excerpt does not clarify how the value of a work is determined; an album or movie could be worth only $15 to millions of dollars depending on whether the value is assessed from the perspective of the consumer or copyright holder. The statute of limitations: 507. Limitations on actions (a) Criminal Proceedings.--No criminal proceeding shall be maintained under the provisions of this title unless it is commenced within five years after the cause of action arose. (b) Civil Actions.--No civil action shall be maintained under the provisions of this title unless it is commenced within three years after the claim accrued. The penalties are too extensive to list here, but they can be found in Section 2319: Criminal infringement of a copyright. In general, first-time criminal offenses will carry a maximum prison sentence of 1 year. I'm still not sure where the DOJ would start in choosing people to prosecute because of the aforementioned ""schooling"" effect, but my guess would be that, just like speeding, primarily the most prominent individuals who operate large servers or transfer the most data will be targeted in order to discourage more recreational file sharers.

There are specific statutory exemptions to the ""first sale"" principle of fair use in the US. For example, audio recordings have such an exemption (dating from the early '80s IIRC), which is why you can't (legally) be in the business of renting audio CDs; the creators can control what you do with it after they've sold it to you. Certain industries would like to extend similar exemptions to other products -- there is no theoretical limit to what Congress could revoke such privileges on. > Access to free stuff often helps to sell other stuff.

The problem with the entertainment industry is that they engage in business and pricing tactics that make anything Microsoft was ever accused of pale in comparison. If they can't figure out how to make money doing something, they'll actually burn money to make sure no ""industry outsider"" can either for all intents and purposes; control is more important than maximizing profit as long as they can make a profit. They don't need your carrot, so they only engage in reasonable business behavior when you are carrying a very large stick, and few people swing a stick large enough. They are being chronically ""investigated"" by the DoJ for anti-trust, collusion, and similar activities, but that is mostly just for show. Which isn't to say that the entertainment industry won't fall victim to its own stupidity, but their ability to do arbitrary and capricious price manipulation with impunity is going to make it a slow decline. -James Rogers jamesr@best.com http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",0

"""R. A. Hettinga"" <rah@shipwright.com>",A Living Memorial,"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA1 Say 'amen' somebody. What the WSJ said, appended below. The WTC, as constructed, was a confiscatory government boondoggle, expropriated from the original pre-construction property owners at the behest of a third-generation trust-fund-aristocrat for the ""good"" of the city, and owned by an ""authority"" looking for something else to do after it, and its coach-hounds in organized labor and organized crime, had killed what was the largest port in the world's richest nation. Now, of course, it's about to get worse. The sins of 40 years ago have been compounded at the hands of two kinds of literally irrational fanatics, first those in religion, and now those in government. As a result, a large part of 10 million square feet of once perfectly usable office space, devoted, at least ostensibly, to commerce, will be ""granted"" away in a potlatch that only government, and special-interest ""communities"", (or ""stakeholders"", or whatever the cryptosocialist psycho-rabble call themselves this week) can organize to such perfection. All this in probably the *only* city in the country that was founded by a *business*, explicitly for the purpose of *commerce*. Not religious fanaticism. Not colonial expansion in a monarch's name. *Commerce*. If they *really* wanted to make a point to the superstitious luddites who collapsed those buildings (using probably the only sharp objects on a plane full of government-disarmed passengers) the so-called ""authority"" should disband itself and sell its property off to the highest bidder and let the *market* -- the cure to all luddism, foreign and domestic, government and superstitious -- decide. If the new, *private* owner wants to sell, or give away, a space for a memorial, fine. They could sell tickets and donate the money to the families of the dead and injured. Probably great for marketing the property, at least during the lifetime of anyone who remembers the event. And, of course, if the new owner wants to build something twice as tall, or with twice as much space than the original 10 million square feet, splendid. Whatever the market will bear. In these days of increasingly ubiquitous trans-national geodesic internetworks, of strong financial cryptography, and of exponentially decreasing transaction costs in formerly monolithic industries, economics and freedom can, and will, prevail over both superstition and statism. It's probably too much to hope for an actual market in lower Manhattan mega-real-estate to prevail this early in the game, but it's going to happen sooner or later. And, whenever it does, *that* will be a fitting memorial to those who died at the World Trade Center. Cheers, RAH - ------- http://online.wsj.com/article_print/0,,SB1031705210159756235,00.html The Wall Street Journal September 11, 2002 REVIEW & OUTLOOK A Living Memorial As we write these words, we can look down from our offices into the six-story crater where the Twin Towers once stood. Like everyone else, we want that site to be rebuilt in a way that honors those who died a year ago. But we also think the best memorial to those who perished would be a living one. The site of the World Trade Center calls forth many emotions, especially today: anger, grief and respect for the many acts of heroism that took place there. But underlying it all is the memory of the enormous vitality that distinguished the towers before they were attacked and was a large reason they were targeted. The best expression of the spirit of New York and of those who died would be to once again see thousands of people from dozens of countries working, meeting, shopping, eating -- that is, engaged in the sort of productive work and play that used to take place there. Osama bin Laden should not be allowed to have turned it into a cemetery. But restoring this memory is not what the discussion in New York has been about. So far no one is talking seriously about the vigorous rebuilding of downtown Manhattan, which lost 100,000 jobs when the Trade Center fell. Instead the discussion centers on the size and scale of the memorial, and on satisfying every political interest now clamoring for a piece of the action. New York's political leadership, and its financial and media elites, are squandering a historic chance to rebuild a better, more prosperous city. This is in part the fault of the commission tasked with figuring out what to do with the site. In consultation with New York Governor George Pataki, who is thinking primarily about his own November re-election, the commission made the decision to focus first on the memorial. The Manhattan Institute's Steve Malanga argues that the commission would have been better off setting aside a limited space for the memorial, getting on with the rebuilding and then returning to the memorial. This is in essence what the Pentagon has so successfully done -- rebuild immediately and set aside two acres for an outdoor memorial, a design for which has yet to be decided. A big part of the problem in New York is that the city's anti-development activists know an opening when they see one. They want the World Trade Center site -- and even some surrounding areas - -- transformed into an enormous park. These political advocates have had plenty of practice at turning proposed development projects in New York into a nightmare of delay and litigation, and the World Trade Center site is now getting the same treatment. Worse, they are cynically using some bereaved family members to advance their own anti-development agenda in the name of ""honoring"" the dead. One family group even called a press conference to reject as disrespectful a proposed train line under the site. We are not experts in designing war memorials, but we're confident that a gigantic park in the heart of the world's financial center isn't the appropriate choice for those who died a year ago. The great cities of Europe and Japan, devastated in World War II, have all rebuilt, and with memorials that are integrated into modern urban life. Perhaps the most powerful is found in Rotterdam, the Dutch port city reduced to rubble by German bombing, where survivors erected a statue of a man with a hole where his heart used to be. In this country, the practice has been for the names of war dead to be inscribed on the walls of institutions with which they were affiliated. If you walk into Nassau Hall at Princeton University, you'll find the names of 644 alumni who died in the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Civil War, the Spanish-American War, World War I, World War II, Korea and Southeast Asia. No one thinks it disrespectful to the dead that the life of the university goes on around the walls containing their names. In New York now, it would help if political leaders looked beyond the emotional tug of the victims and their families to the city's future. Rudolph Giuliani, now that he's out office, wants the entire 16 acres devoted to the memorial. Governor Pataki has called for no structures on the ""footprints,"" which, being in the center of the site, would severely curtail options. Mayor Michael Bloomberg initially raised his voice in favor of commercial development but was bloodied by the press and has since ducked for cover. Maybe things will be different after this anniversary is past. Maybe those responsible for the World Trade Center site will start thinking more about the next 50 or 100 years than the past 12 months.

Incredibly, this institution puts out pages and pages of high-quality professional content each week and then distributes them by means of men in trucks across the country overnight where they sit, waiting to be sold to people. Meanwhile, the exact same content is available _for free_ using an insidious peer-to-peer downloading system called ""the Web"" by typing in the keyword ""www.nytimes.com"". Those people at the New York Times must not understand the Internet or something! More examples: the thriving shareware market, the Baen Free Library, Janis Ian and others.

nobody@dogma.slashnull.org,blogged item,"BlogStart: **Dublin**: something from the archives. Daev Walsh forwards an article from The Irish Digest about ''Billy in the Bowl''. This story is also immortalised in an old Dublin song, which in turn was mentioned in a Pogues track. Billy was a legless beggar in the alleys of Stoneybatter and Grangegorman (where I now live) during the 18th century, who discovered a new, but not entirely legal, way to make money. BlogEnd: LinkText: Billy in the Bowl From: daev <hellshaw@fringeware.com> Subject: The Case of the Stoneybatter Strangler A story of my new neighbourhood... The Irish Digest July 1964 The Case of the Stoneybatter Strangler The handsome, deformed Billy in the Bowl evolved a plan to rob his donors. Then, one night, he made the biggest mistake of his life DUBLIN in the eighteenth century was noted for two things - the architectural beauty of its public buildings and the large number of beggars who sought alms in its maze of streets and lanes. Many of these beggars relied on visitors and the gentry for their coin, but there was one who campaigned among the working class. This was ""Billy In The Bowl"" The strange appellation was derived from the fact that Billy's sole means of transport was a large bowl-shaped car with wheels. Seated in this "" bowl "", the beggar would propel himself along by pushing against the ground with wooden plugs, one in each hand. Billy's unusual means of conveyance was vitally necessary, as he had been born without legs. Nature, however, had compensated for this by endowing him with powerful arms and shoulders and, what was most important, an unusually handsome face. This was Billy's greatest asset in his daily routine of separating sympathetic passers-by from their small change. The cunning young beggar would wait at a convenient spot on one of the many lonely roads or lanes which were a feature of eighteenth century Grangegorman and Stoneybatter, until a servant girl or an old lady would come along. He would then put on is most attractive smile which, together with his black curly hair, never failed to halt the females. The fact that such a handsome young man was so terribly handicapped physically always evoked pity. ""Billy in the Bowl"", however, wasn't satisfied with becoming the daily owner of a generous number of small coins; what his greed demanded were substantial sums of money. The more he managed to get the more he could indulge in his pet vices - gambling and drinking. As a result the beggar evolved a plan to rob unsuspecting sympathisers. The first time lie put his plan into operation was on a cold March evening as dusk, was falling. The victim was a middle aged woman who was passing through Grangegorman Lane on her way to visit friends in Queen Street - on Dublin's North Quays. When Billy heard the woman's footsteps, he hid behind some bushes in a ditch which skirted the lane. As his unsuspecting victim drew close, the beggar moaned and shouted, and cried out for help. Trembling with excitement, the woman dashed to the spot where Billy lay concealed. She bent down to help the beggar out of the ditch, when two powerful arms closed around her throat and pulled her into the bushes. In a few minutes it was all over. The woman lay in a dead faint, and Billy was travelling at a fast rate down the lane in his "" bowl "", his victirn's purse snug in his coat pocket. An hour after the robbery the woman was found in a distracted condition, but failed to give a description of her assailant. And, as ""Billy in the Bowl"" had figured, nobody would suspect a deformed beggar. Again and again the beggar carried out his robbery plan, always shifting the place of attack to a different part of Grangegorman or Stoneybatter.",0

The modem handshake works at slightly higher speeds (4800bps to ~57600bps) but that is no good for tx/rx'ing data to the remote server as it insists at talking at the speed of treacle/1200bps. Note Minicom fails to handshake at 1200bps, but HyperTerm in Windows worked first time(!?), any ideas?

QED. My typical Java-to-C conversion doesn't increase the lines of code by more than 20%, and a fair portion of that is the implementation of additional features that drove us to do the conversion in the first place. Some things are substantially more succinct when written in C than in Java. C and most other mature languages have an endless collection of libraries.

khare@alumni.caltech.edu,NYTimes.com Article: Vast Detail on Towers' Collapse May Be Sealed,"This article from NYTimes.com has been sent to you by khare@alumni.caltech.edu. Another reminder that the moral writ of intellectual property is -- and ought to --be more limited than real property. Private money paid for these bits, but expropriation may be fairer for IP than real-P. Rohit khare@alumni.caltech.edu Vast Detail on Towers' Collapse May Be Sealed September 30, 2002 By JAMES GLANZ and ERIC LIPTON What is almost certainly the most sophisticated and complete understanding of exactly how and why the twin towers of the World Trade Center fell has been compiled as part of a largely secret proceeding in federal court in Lower Manhattan. Amassed during the initial stages of a complicated insurance lawsuit involving the trade center, the confidential material contains data and expert analysis developed by some of the nation's most respected engineering minds. It includes computer calculations that have produced a series of three-dimensional images of the crumpled insides of the towers after the planes hit, helping to identify the sequence of failures that led to the collapses. An immense body of documentary evidence, like maps of the debris piles, rare photos and videos, has also been accumulated in a collection that far outstrips what government analysts have been able to put together as they struggle to answer the scientifically complex and emotionally charged questions surrounding the deadly failures of the buildings. But everyone from structural engineers to relatives of victims fear that the closely held information, which includes the analysis and the possible answers that families and engineers around the world have craved, may remain buried in sealed files, or even destroyed. Bound by confidentiality agreements with their clients, the experts cannot disclose their findings publicly as they wait for the case to play out. Such restrictions are typical during the discovery phase of litigation. And as it now stands, the judge in the case - who has agreed that certain material can remain secret for the time being - has approved standard legal arrangements that, should the lawsuit be settled before trial, could cause crucial material generated by the competing sides to be withheld. ""We're obviously in favor of releasing the information, but we can't until we're told what to do,"" said Matthys Levy, an engineer and founding partner at Weidlinger Associates, who is a consultant in the case and the author of ""Why Buildings Fall Down: How Structures Fail"" (Norton, 2nd edition, 2002). ""Let's just say we understand the mechanics of the whole process"" of the collapse, Mr. Levy said. Monica Gabrielle, who lost her husband, Richard, when the south tower fell and who is a member of the Skyscraper Safety Campaign, said the information should be disclosed. ""If they have answers and are not going to share them, I would be devastated,"" Mrs. Gabrielle said. ""They have a moral obligation."" The lawsuit that has generated the information involves Larry A. Silverstein, whose companies own a lease on the trade center property, and a consortium of insurance companies. Mr. Silverstein maintains that each jetliner that hit the towers constituted a separate terrorist attack, entitling him to some $7 billion, rather than half that amount, as the insurance companies say. As both sides have prepared their arguments, they have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars acquiring expert opinion about exactly what happened to the towers. Dean Davison, a spokesman for Industrial Risk Insurers of Hartford, one of the insurance companies in the suit, said of the findings, ""There are some confidentiality agreements that are keeping those out of the public domain today."" He conceded that differing opinions among the more than 20 insurers on his side of the case could complicate any release of the material. As for his own company, whose consultants alone have produced more than 1,700 pages of analysis and thousands of diagrams and photographs, Mr. Davison said every attempt would be made to give the material eventually to ""public authorities and investigative teams."" Still, some of that analysis relies on information like blueprints and building records from other sources, like the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which built and owned the trade center and supports Mr. Silverstein in the suit. Mr. Davison said he was uncertain how the differing origins of the material would influence his company's ability to release information. In a statement, the Port Authority said access to documents would be ""decided on a case-by-case basis consistent with applicable law and policy,"" adding that it would cooperate with ""federal investigations."" The fate of the research is particularly critical to resolve unanswered questions about why the towers fell, given the dissatisfaction with the first major inquiry into the buildings' collapse. That investigation, led by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, was plagued by few resources, a lack of access to crucial information like building plans, and infighting among experts and officials. A new federal investigation intended to remedy those failings has just begun at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST, an agency that has studied many building disasters. Officials with NIST have said it could take years to make final determinations and recommendations for other buildings, a process they now acknowledge might be speeded up with access to the analysis done by the consultants on the lawsuit. Gerald McKelvey, a spokesman for Mr. Silverstein, said of the real estate executive's own heavily financed investigative work, ""We decline to comment other than to say that Silverstein is cooperating fully with the NIST investigation."" A spokesman for the agency confirmed it was in discussions with Mr. Silverstein on the material, but said no transfer had taken place. With no shortage of money or expertise, investigations by both sides in the legal case have produced a startling body of science and theory, some of it relevant not only to the trade center disaster but to other skyscrapers as well. ""The work should be available to other investigators,"" said Ramon Gilsanz, a structural engineer and managing partner at Gilsanz Murray Steficek, who was a member of the earlier inquiry. ""It could be used to build better buildings in the future."" Legal experts say confidentiality arrangements like the one governing the material can lead to a variety of outcomes, from full or partial disclosure to destruction of such information. In some cases, litigants who paid for the reports may make them public themselves. Or they may ask to have them sealed forever. ""It is not unusual for one party or another to try to keep some of those documents secret for one reason or another, some legitimate, some not,"" said Lee Levine, a First Amendment lawyer at Levine Sullivan & Koch in Washington. Mr. Levine said that because of the presumed value of the information, the court might look favorably on requests to make it public. But the uncertainty over the fate of the material is unnerving to many people, especially experts who believe that only a complete review of the evidence - not piecemeal disclosures by litigants eager to protect their own interests - could lead to an advance in the federal investigation of the trade center. ""It's important for this to get presented and published and subjected to some scrutiny,"" said Dr. John Osteraas, director of civil engineering practice at Exponent Failure Analysis in Menlo Park, Calif., and a consultant on the case, ""because then the general engineering community can sort it out."" The scope of the investigation behind the scenes is vast by any measure. Mr. Levy and his colleagues at Weidlinger Associates, hired by Silverstein Properties, have called upon powerful computer programs, originally developed with the Pentagon for classified research, to create a model of the Sept. 11 attack from beginning to end. The result is a compilation of three-dimensional images of the severed exterior columns, smashed floor and damaged core of the towers, beginning with the impacts and proceeding up to the moments of collapse. Those images - which Mr. Levy is not allowed to release - have helped pinpoint the structural failures. The FEMA investigators did not have access to such computer modeling. Nor did the FEMA team have unfettered access to the trade center site, with all its evidence, in the weeks immediately after the attacks. But no such constraints hampered engineers at LZA/Thornton-Tomasetti, brought to the site for emergency work beginning on the afternoon of Sept. 11. Daniel A. Cuoco, the company president and a consultant to Silverstein Properties on the case, said he had assembled detailed maps of the blazing debris at ground zero in models that perhaps contain further clues about how the towers fell. Though the FEMA team could not determine ""where things actually fell,"" Mr. Cuoco said, ""we've indicated the specific locations."" Mr. Cuoco said he could not reveal any additional details of the findings. Nor would Mr. Osteraas discuss the details of computer calculations his company has done on the spread of fires in large buildings like the twin towers. Mr. Osteraas has also compiled an extensive archive of photographs and videos of the towers that day, some of which he believes have not been available to other investigators. And the investigation has not limited itself to computers and documentary evidence. For months, experiments in wind tunnels in the United States and Canada have been examining the aerodynamics that fed the flames that day and stressed the weakening structures. Jack Cermak, president of Cermak Peterka Peterson in Fort Collins, Colo., was retained by the insurance companies but had previously performed wind-tunnel studies for the original design of the twin towers nearly 40 years ago. For the legal case, Dr. Cermak said, ""we've done probably more detailed measurements than in the original design."" ""The data that have been acquired are very valuable in themselves for understanding how wind and buildings interact,"" Dr. Cermak said. ""Some of the information may be valuable for the litigation,"" he said, adding, ""I think I've told you all I can."" http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/30/nyregion/30TOWE.html?ex=1034388663&ei=1&en=0d3143a997e5e2e1 HOW TO ADVERTISE --------------------------------- For information on advertising in e-mail newsletters or other creative advertising opportunities with The New York Times on the Web, please contact onlinesales@nytimes.com or visit our online media kit at http://www.nytimes.com/adinfo For general information about NYTimes.com, write to help@nytimes.com.

It occurs at the very end of an excellent article which I recommend to you. In the story, an old man enters a church where the congregation has been listening to an heroic sermon about ""the glory to be won in battle by young patriots armed with the love of God."" He usurps the pulpit and prays the following: ""O Lord our God, help us to tear their soldiers to bloody shreads with our shells; help us to cover their smiling fields with the pale forms of their patriot dead; help us to drown the thunder of the guns with the shrieks of their wounded, writhing in pain; help us to lay waste their humble homes with a hurricane of fire; help us to wring the hearts of their unoffending widows with unavailing grief; help us to turn them out roofless with their little children to wander unfriended the wastes of their desolated land in rags and hunger and thirst, sports of the sun flames in summer and the icy winds of winter, broken in spirit, worn with travail, imploring Thee for the refuge of the grave and denied it -- for our sakes who adore Thee, Lord, blast their hopes, blight their lives, protract their bitter pilgrimage, make heavy their steps, water their way with their tears, stain the white snow with the blood of their wounded feet! We ask it, in the spirit of love, of Him Who is the Source of Love, and Who is the ever-faithful refuge and friend of all that are sore beset and seek His aid with humble and contrite hearts. Amen."" Twain wrote the story, ""The War Prayer,"" in 1905 during the American occupation of the Philippines, but the story wasn't printed until 1923, thirteen years after his death, because the editors thought it ""unsuitable"" for publication at the time it was written. # distributed via <nettime>: no commercial use without permission # <nettime> is a moderated mailing list for net criticism, # collaborative text filtering and cultural politics of the nets # more info: majordomo@bbs.thing.net and ""info nettime-l"" in the msg body # archive: http://www.nettime.org contact: nettime@bbs.thing.net --- end forwarded text -- ----------------- R.

If you want SA to tag all messages listed in Razor then you can put this in your ~/.spamassassin/user_prefs file. score RAZOR_CHECK 10 The default score is 3 and the default threshold needed is 5. Therefore if you wish to have any razor listed messages tagged by SA then setting a score for any razor listed messages to anything above 5 would be sufficient. If you are already using SA then the above would be more efficient. Otherwise you are running all of the mail through razor twice, once for SA and once again afterward. If you really want to run Razor individually then you should set the 'score RAZOR_CHECK 0' so that SA won't do it and avoid the double network hit. However, one of the benefits of using SA in combination with Razor has been the history of false positive reports in the razor database. The current score of 3 is hefty, but not enough by itself to tag as spam. But for any real spam is usually enough to push it over the threshold. Razor2 addresses the false positive problem but is not yet in as wide of use as Razor1. Bob",0

I've always found archaeology interesting for no particular reason.

""It looked like a bison skull,"" the building contractor and amateur archaeologist recalls. ""I thought, 'That's strange. Bison don't live this high up.' "" Knapp brought the skull to the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, where scientists last month announced that it was indeed from a bison–one that died about 340 years ago. ""This was an extraordinary discovery,"" says Russ Graham, the museum's chief curator, adding that it could alter notions of the mountain environment centuries ago. ""There's probably a lot more like it yet to be found."" And not just bison. Colorado isn't the only place where glaciers and snowfields are melting. Decades of unusual warmth in regions from Peru to Alaska–a trend some think is linked to emissions from cars and industry–have shrunk or thawed many of the world's 70,000 glaciers. As the ice recedes, a treasure-trove of human and animal artifacts is emerging, extraordinarily well preserved after centuries in the deep freeze. The fabrics, wood, bone, and DNA-rich tissue found on the mucky fringes of the ice are revising scientists' understanding of our predecessors' health, habits, and technology, and the prey they pursued. ""It's mind-boggling how many different fields are being advanced through studying these remains,"" says Johan Reinhard, a high-altitude archaeologist and explorer-in-residence at the National Geographic Society. Rare, spectacular finds like the frozen mummies he discovered in the Andes of Peru in the 1990s and the legendary 5,300-year-old ""Ice Man,"" found at the edge of a receding glacier in the Alps in 1991, have offered time capsules of cultural and biological information. Now, as the ice continues to retreat, it is yielding not just occasional treasures but long records of humans and animals in the high mountains. Vanishing act. The trick is finding such specimens before Mother Nature–and looters–take them first. Once uncovered, frozen remains can deteriorate within hours or be gnawed by animals. Moreover, they're often so well preserved when they emerge that people who come upon them don't even realize they're ancient. That was the case when three men hunting sheep near a high glacier in British Columbia, Canada, three years ago saw what they thought was a dead animal. ""It looked a little like sealskin buried in the ice,"" recalls Warren Ward, a teacher from nearby Nelson. ""But when I looked closer I could see leather fringe from a coat and finger bones."" Figuring they had found the remains of another hunter, or perhaps a fur trapper, the men stowed a flint knife and other artifacts in a Zip-Loc bag and delivered them to local officials. Archaeologists later exhumed the fallen hunter's body, along with a woven hat, fur clothing, and what seemed to be a medicine bag. Carbon dating revealed that the hunter lived about 550 years ago. Dubbed Kwaday Dan Ts'inchi, or Long Ago Person Found, by people of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations (who may be his direct descendants), he is perhaps the best-preserved human from the period ever found in North America. Other findings from melting ice in the neighboring Yukon region could explain what that long-ago person was doing in the mountains in the first place. ""Before this there was no archaeological record of people living here,"" says Greg Hare, a Yukon government archaeologist. ""Now we see that this area was very much part of people's seasonal activities."" Like Ward's discovery, the search began by chance, when Kristin Benedek caught a whiff of what smelled like a barnyard as she and her husband, Gerry Kuzyk, hunted sheep at 6,000 feet in the mountains of the south Yukon. They followed the scent to a melting patch of ice covered in caribou dung. ""It was really odd, because I knew there hadn't been caribou in the area for at least 100 years,"" recalls Kuzyk, then a wildlife biologist with the Yukon government. Caribou cake. Returning a week later, he found ""what looked like a pencil with string wrapped around it."" It turned out to be a 4,300-year-old atlatl, or spear thrower. Further investigation of the ice patch–and scores of others around the region–revealed icy layer cakes filled with caribou remains and human detritus chronicling 7,800 years of changing hunting practices. Scientists now believe ancient caribou and other animals flocked to the ice each summer to cool down and escape swarming mosquitoes and flies. Hunters followed the game. They returned for centuries and discarded some equipment in the ice. ""We've got people hunting with throwing darts up until 1,200 years ago,"" says Hare, who now oversees the research project. ""Then we see the first appearance of the bow and arrow about 1,300 years ago. And by 1,200 years ago, there's no more throwing darts."" Now scientists are trying to make the search less a matter of luck. They are developing sophisticated computer models that combine data on where glaciers are melting fastest and where humans and animals are known to have migrated to pinpoint the best places to search in Alaska's Wrangell and St. Elias mountain ranges–the United States' most glaciated terrain–and in the Andes. Johan Reinhard thinks the fast- thawing European Alps could also deliver more findings, perhaps as exquisite as the Ice Man. ""Global warming is providing us high-altitude archaeologists with some fantastic opportunities right now. We're probably about the only ones happy about it.""",0

Well, I think until recently, support for most things on Linux was kind of shady... Things have got much better... You're right in that the JDK used to suck on Linux... But then, IMHO, Linux is still maturing.... or at least development tools for Linux are maturing... I've been developing a few server side apps that run on Linux recently with JDK 1.3.x and they've had no problems with great performance. Robert Harley worte: >Microsoft has announced that they plan to remove Java from Windows. >They took it out of XP already and it has to be installed with a >service pack. Somehow, I can't imagine them removing the ability to >run C programs. Hmmm... Do you really think that MS is pulling out Java because it's a ""Bad"" programming language or application platform? You don't think this has anything to do with .NET being a competitor to Java do you? Or that MS has basically copied Java (with some additional features) and called it C#? Isn't that alone an indication that they actually DO think that a VM is the right way to go for most high level applications? Reza B'Far wrote: >2.

You're telling me that you've never had a nasty bug that took you a couple of days to track down that had to do with a memory leak? I am not the best C/C++ programmer... not even close... But I've known really good ones... and even they have nasty bugs that have to do with memory management, however occasional they may be. >It's about design patterns, architecture, high level stuff... Robert Harley wrote: >If your problem just requires application of a ""design pattern"" to solve, >then it's trivial anyway irrespective of language. Wow! So you're telling me that unless the application involves bit-counting, it's trivial? What about the application itself? What about high level problems such as task distribution, work-flow, etc.? Aren't most high level problems solved with high level solutions like design patterns? Or do you solve high level problems by writing optimal C/C++ code? For example, do you think that most people working on collaboration frameworks (there are lots of them on this list), are working on writing an operating system with assembly that provides for a collaborative environment? >I am amazed by the amount of time wasted by people talking about low >level problems that have been solved 10 million times over and over >and over again... Robert Harley wrote: >You appear to be gratuitously asserting that C programmers waste time >on irrelevant low-level problems and Java programmers don't. Depends >entirely on the programmer, not the language. I can see how you could infer this. However, what I believe to really be the case is that Java is one of the best languages for writing large applications with many components that involves the collaboration of more than three programmers. In those cases, it's always very hard to get the programmers to agree on API's, memory management techniques, etc. With Java, the JCP takes care of the discussions so that you don't sit around in a long meeting trying to decide what API to use to hook up to a database (JDBC) or a messaging bus (JMS). >3.

I'd like to know if there is one accepted by everyone who writes C/C++... In that case, I claim ignorance... Not suggesting that Java is the golden hammer.... Just that C/C++ is overkill for most things... I even coded in VB... But VB is a true disgrace to programming... It's just lame... Java is Object Oriented...

Have I got something confused here? No, but either due to some technical glitch, or downright just wanting to do so, people send to the secondary. It's a semi-usual spammer trick actually to bypass the main server and send directly to a secondary since it will either have less filtering, or be ""trusted"", or ... MX records in the mail world are all explained in RFC 2821, section 5: [...] Multiple MX records contain a preference indication that MUST be used in sorting (see below). Lower numbers are more preferred than higher ones. If there are multiple destinations with the same preference and there is no clear reason to favor one (e.g., by recognition of an easily-reached address), then the sender-SMTP MUST randomize them to spread the load across multiple mail exchangers for a specific organization. [...] If it determines that it should relay the message without rewriting the address, it MUST sort the MX records to determine candidates for delivery. The records are first ordered by preference, with the lowest-numbered records being most preferred. The relay host MUST then inspect the list for any of the names or addresses by which it might be known in mail transactions. If a matching record is found, all records at that preference level and higher-numbered ones MUST be discarded from consideration. If there are no records left at that point, it is an error condition, and the message MUST be returned as undeliverable. If records do remain, they SHOULD be tried, best preference first, as described above. -- Randomly Generated Tagline: ""Now let's say I like sheep...

It also claims to provide kernel-sources at the same version. That is enough to make alsa-driver.spec happy, and at least forms a reasonable representation of what my homemade kernel provides to the system.

John Hall <johnhall@evergo.net>,Colonial Script ...,"Oh, they were plenty upset about the tea taxes. But the crack down on colonial script certainly screwed over the American Colonies. And, BTW, England as well. Dear Ben Franklin was right for the wrong reasons. First of all the colonies were not prosperous compared to England proper. Second, the issuance of colonial script had nothing to do with full employeement. (In fact, it is almost inconceivable he would make that claim. It sounds like a modern Keynsian was creating an urban legend.) OTOH the lack of sufficient circulating monetary instruments was economically crippling. Imagine trying to buy your supplies by offering IOUs on your own name -- and then trying to market / exchange the paper as the merchant who took the IOU. =========================== The most common problem in the world is when a government prints too much money. The effects are a complete disaster. There are a lot of incentives that push governments into doing this even though it is incredibly stupid. So almost all the literature talks about that. But you can ALSO screw an economy over by taking all the money out of circulation. The fundamental cause of the American Great Depression was exactly this, courtesy of the Federal Reserve Board. I don't think shifting the power to print money to the bank of Canada had much effect.

I'm skeptical. One of the many perversions of modern civilization is the fictitious rendering of various peoples, frequently to the point where the fiction is more ""real"" than the reality. You see it over and over again in history: The Primitive People pull a fast one on Whitey The Junior Anthropologist, playing to all the prejudices of Whitey (who only became Junior Anthropologists to support personal ideologies), and before you know it the charade takes on a life of its own which the Primitive People are compelled to perpetuate. Worse, even when there is substantial evidence to the contrary with some basic scholarship, the facts have a hard time competing with the ideologically pleasing fiction that is already firmly entrenched. And many peoples (e.g. American Indians) develop a profit motive for maintaining and promoting the myth in popular culture. I'm far more inclined to believe that people is people, no matter where you are on the planet. The only time you see any anomalies is when you have a self-selecting sub-population within an otherwise normal population, which is hardly a fair way to look at any major population. -James Rogers jamesr@best.com",0

James Rogers <jamesr@best.com>,RE: Goodbye Global Warming,"""the historical record"", by which you mean *human* historical record, is highly overrated (nigh worthless) when you are talking about geological timescales, even on topics with as short a timescale as climate. My problem with global warming (or cooling for that matter), is that the supposedly profound recent changes in temperature, both in absolute terms and as a function time, very arguably fall well below the noise floor of the natural fluctuations that have occurred over the last 50,000 years both in terms of absolute average temperature and the rate of temperature change. People unfamiliar with history of global temperature since the advent of modern humans may think that a degree here or there over a century is a lot, not realizing that global temperatures regularly whipsaw with far greater extremity. I therefore immediately dismiss any theory of global warming that cannot explain why temperatures whipsawed more severely in pre-history than in the last couple thousand years (which have been relatively calm by geological standards). This is a very inconvenient fact for people trying to use climate to push a particular social agenda. It is worth noting that underneath the receding glaciers deposited during the last major ice age, they are finding substantial evidence of humans living in what was a nice temperate climate before the glaciers paved over their civilization. The receding glaciers have turned into a bit of an archaeological treasure chest, as they expose artifacts buried in and underneath them as they shrink that have been preserved by the ice for thousands of years. I don't see any compelling reason to ""save the glaciers"" anyway, particularly in light of the fact that their existence has always been transient. For anyone to insist that the current negligible fluctuations are anthropogenic just heaps one ridiculous assertion upon another. I'll just stick with Occam's Razor for now. In my humble opinion.

For a long time I have used an external editor with exmh (gvim). I can cut'n'paste from exmh's message display window into spawned gvim processes, but not into anything else. This is VERY annoying. (I have to look at the message with cat or less or whatever in a terminal window if I want to do this - which is quite often. And if the message is q-p encoded or a non-text/plain mime type, I end up with all that raw garbage too). Anyway to fix this?

Errrr....the biz guys in my office don't care what the ""WISPs"" want to do with their little WiFi networks. And the bandwidth shadows in most cities are surprisingly large and common. They aren't selling the software, which is pretty pricy as it happens. They are using it to optimize next generation wireless canopies over metro areas and fiber networks on a large scale. There are an essentially infinite number of metro wireless configurations, some of which generate far more dead or marginal spots and others which are very expensive to operate (due to backhaul transit considerations) or both. This software can be used as a tool to optimize the canopy coverage and minimize the actual transit costs since the wireless is tied into fiber at multiple points. The canopies we are talking about aren't short-range wifi technologies, but a mixture of long-range high-performance wireless networking, with bandwidth measured in tens to hundreds of mbits and ranges measured in miles (up to well over a hundred miles on the extreme end). At those ranges and bandwidth levels, the cost of providing the network can easily vary by an order of magnitude or more depending on how you manage RF shadows and proximity to fiber access points. The idea ultimately is to optimize the cost and performance such that no existing network infrastructure providers can remotely compete and maintain profitability. This is a surprisingly low bar, and it is about time networks were designed with this level of large-scale optimization (cost per mbit, maximizing coverage, and effective bandwidth available per unit area) in any case. And for this company's long-term plans, this type of capability will be absolutely necessary to keep things sane. Or at least investors find this capability very sexy and compelling, especially since we have this lovely visualization engine tied into the system (CLI batches never have the same effect, even if it is more efficient). -James Rogers jamesr@best.com",0

"""Everhart, Glenn (FUSA)"" <GlennEverhart@firstusa.com>",RE: use of base image / delta image for automated recovery from a ttacks,"I did something crudely along those lines for VMS VAX maybe 13 years ago; there is at least one product that does it for PC though I don't recall its name. It is also handy for cases where you have a CD image of some filesystem (or some other image of a filesystem) that is intrinsically readonly but whose filesystem will not accept (or is not graceful) readonly storage. It is also more or less necessary if you want to work with WORM file structures, which are older still. There have been a number of filesystems for those dating back to the early 1980s if not before. A generic facility of the type you mention is also one way to implement snapshots on top of an existing filesystem. The written information must (obviously!) be seekable so you can provide the illusion that you wrote to the storage. A device level implementation is however perfectly adequate. It does not, of course, distinguish for you what should have been changed and what should not. If you truly know a device (or perhaps a partition) must not be written, it can be simpler to either return error on writes, or to just return a fake success on writes yet discard the data. (NTFS lives with the latter strategy just fine from my experiments. I have not tried it on extf3 or reiser.) BTW, think about your mention of RAID and consider the complexity of writing to RAID4 or RAID5... I would contend that with cheaper storage these days, it makes little sense to use RAID, save for shadowing and possibly striping. Those at least do not have the complexity and slowup dangers that higher RAID levels have, and there is not a need to save the cost of disk so much where a single disk may hold 200 gigs and up. Why not dedicate another whole disk to fault recovery and lose the complexity and slow write (sometimes) of RAID? Glenn Everhart -----Original Message----- From: bmord@icon-nicholson.com [mailto:bmord@icon-nicholson.com] Sent: Tuesday, September 03, 2002 3:04 PM To: Webappsec Securityfocus.Com; SECPROG Securityfocus Subject: use of base image / delta image for automated recovery from attacks Hi, I was inspired by a mode of operation supported by VMWare. You can have a base disk image shared by multiple virtual machine (vm) instances. That base image is never altered by a vm instance. Instead, each vm instance writes changes to its own ""redo"" log. Future hard disk reads from that vm instance incorporate both the base image and the appropriate redo log to present the current disk image for that specific virtual machine. This is described here (thanks to Duane for providing this link on the honeypots mailing list) http://www.vmware.com/support/reference/common/disk_sharing.html Could this basic concept be used to easily make self-fixing client/server applications that efficiently and automatically recover from most attacks, even before those attacks have been discovered? Here is what I imagine. The physical architectures of most production client/server systems are layered. For example, your basic web application might have a web server running Apache, connected to an application server running some J2EE or .Net business logic, connected to a database server for persistence. The only one of these whose disk image really should evolve over time is the database server, and even here you often put the static RDBMS software on one partition and the changeable datafiles on another partition. It is only the partition with the volatile datafiles that must be allowed to change from one boot to the next. Other paritions may need to be writable for, say, swap space, but these changes could be eliminated on each reboot. When someone cracks this system, they will probably change an image that shouldn't be changed. E.g., they might leverage a buffer overflow in IIS or Apache to install a trojan or a backdoor on the more exposed web server. But what if the web server ran off a base image, writing changes to a ""delta"" or ""redo"" partition? And then what if every night it automatically erased the redo partition and rebooted? The downtime involved for each machine would be minimal, because it is only deleting data - rather than restoring from backup. In a system with redundant web servers for load balancing or high availability, this could be scheduled in a way such that the system is always accessible. This base/redo partition concept could be implemented at the same level as a feature of hardware RAID, allowing for greater performance, reliability, and hack resistance. This concept could also be applied to the application servers, and even the database server partitions (except for those partitions which contain the table data files, of course.) Does anyone do this already? Or is this a new concept? Or has this concept been discussed before and abandoned for some reasons that I don't yet know? I use the physical architecture of a basic web application as an example in this post, but this concept could of course be applied to most server systems. It would allow for the hardware-separation of volatile and non-volatile disk images. It would be analogous to performing nightly ghosting operations, only it would be more efficient and involve less (or no) downtime.

""Duncan"" Beberg http://www.mithral.com/~beberg/ beberg@mithral.com Pitch Dark Bar Opens for Blind Dates Thu Sep 5,10:09 AM ET BERLIN (Reuters) - Diners at Berlin's newest restaurant cannot see what they are eating and have to be guided to their table by blind waiters because the bar is pitch black. The restaurant, which opened Wednesday, aims to make guests concentrate on senses other than sight. Holding on to one another, the first visitors followed waiter Roland Zimmermann, 33, into the dining room. Although the PhD student has been blind since childhood, he is the only one able to point out chairs, cutlery and drinks. ""I'm putting your plate right in front of you,"" Zimmermann said. ""I can't find my mouth,"" one voice replied out of the dark. ""I wonder what this dish is -- Lasagne? Or some casserole?"" another invisible guest said. In the ""unsicht-Bar,"" which means invisible in German, diners cannot choose complete dishes from the menu but can only indicate whether they would like a fish, meat or vegetarian option. ""We want people to have an extraordinary experience of tasting, feeling and smelling,"" said Manfred Scharbach, head of the organization for blind and sight-restricted people, which is running the bar. ""People are surprised that their tongues and taste senses are taking over and are sending signals, which their eyes would normally have sent,"" he added. Of the 30 staff, 22 are blind. An average meal lasts about three hours and the waiters are always around to help, Scharnbach said. And at the end of the night, they will even reveal what customers have actually been eating.",0

The birds were spotted by the crew of a USAF jet returning to base in New Zealand. Researchers had feared that a breakaway iceberg the size of Jamaica had all but wiped out the colony at Cape Crozier on Ross Island. Thousands of chicks are believed to have died as an increase in sea ice made it impossible for the adults to find food. A detailed count is planned in October. Antarctica (New Zealand) chief executive Lou Sanson said: ""The penguins were in a big huddle. We can now hope that the emperors have had a successful breeding season over the winter."" Some 1,000 pairs of emperors - the largest penguins in the world at 3.3ft tall and 88lb - usually nest at Cape Crozier, 50 miles from the US McMurdo research station. The 200,000-strong Adelie penguin colony, which also nests at the cape, may have lost up to third of its population. ------------------------ Yahoo!

This is a good point. There are a lot of alternatives to hydrocarbon products derived from petroleum, but these have often been developed as a replacement for petroleum after the technology has been established - there is a growing industry in plant-derived plastics and lubricants, but this is to replicate materials that have been previously created much more easily within the petrochemical industry. Vegetable-derived lubricants have been used. The Russians used sunflower oil in the lubrication systems of tanks and trucks during the second world war, and work is being done in the UK to produce diesel fuel derived from waste cooking oil from fast-food restaurants. Jay's correct in his opinion that vegetable oil is not as durable as petroleum oil, but this is only because of the lack of sophistication of the chemistry involved. Synthetic fuels and lubricants are continuously being developed, and I don't see any problems with synthetics ultimately matching the performance of the more conventional products. As the rock oil runs out, plant oil derivatives *will* be developed to fill the gap. In parallel, changes will occur in the designs of the machines to cope with any changes in performance of the lubricants. My big concern is if the technology were ever to be lost for some reason. Re-creating a petrochemical industry from scratch without petrochemicals (that is, going immediately to plant-based synthetics) would be extremely difficult, especially if it were necessary to recreate *all* of the petrochemical-derived products (not just lubricants and fuels). I suspect that, bearing in mind the ingenuity of the human race, it would happen, just at a different pace. Imagine an industrial revollution based on, for example, methane from pig manure, or diesel oil from sunflowers. All we would then have to do is get used to all the machines smelling like pig farms and fish and chip shops...

The accuracy and reliability of temperature data gathered by the satellites since January 1979 has been confirmed by comparing the satellite data to independent temperature data. A recent study (1) found a 97 percent agreement between the MSU data and temperatures measured by thermometers suspended beneath weather balloons released by meteorologists for weather observations. Once the monthly temperature data is collected from the satellites and processed, it is placed in a ""public"" computer file for immediate access by atmospheric scientists in the U.S. and abroad. It has become the basis for a number of major studies in global climate change, and is cited in reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. GATHERING THE DATA While traditional thermometers measure the temperature at a specific point in the air, a microwave sounding unit on a satellite takes readings that are average temperatures in a huge volume of the atmosphere. Each of the more than 30,000 readings per day per satellite is an average temperature for more than 75,000 cubic kilometers of air. The MSU makes a direct measurement of the temperature by looking at microwaves emitted by oxygen molecules in the atmosphere. The intensity of the microwave emissions - their ""brightness"" - varies according to temperature. Christy and Spencer developed a method to take the data from several satellites and produce a unified temperature dataset. VERIFYING THE ACCURACY OF MSU MEASUREMENTS A recent comparison (1) of temperature readings from two major climate monitoring systems - microwave sounding units on satellites and thermometers suspended below helium balloons - found a ""remarkable"" level of agreement between the two. To verify the accuracy of temperature data collected by microwave sounding units, Christy compared temperature readings recorded by ""radiosonde"" thermometers to temperatures reported by the satellites as they orbited over the balloon launch sites. He found a 97 percent correlation over the 16-year period of the study. The overall composite temperature trends at those sites agreed to within 0.03 degrees Celsius (about 0.054° Fahrenheit) per decade. The same results were found when considering only stations in the polar or arctic regions. ""The idea was to determine the reliability of the satellite data by comparing it to an established independent measurement,"" Christy said. ""If satellite data are reliable when the satellites are over the radiosonde sites, that means you should be able to trust them everywhere else."" The 99 radiosondes reported an aggregate warming trend of 0.155 degrees Celsius (about 0.28° Fahrenheit) per decade since 1979. Over those 99 spots on the globe, the satellites also recorded a warming trend: 0.128 degrees Celsius (about 0.23° Fahrenheit) per decade. Globally, however, the satellite data show a cooling trend of 0.03 degrees Celsius per decade since the first NOAA TIROS-N satellites went into service. ""These 99 radiosonde launch sites are just not distributed evenly around the planet,"" Christy said. ""They are not representative of the total globe."" Radiosonde balloons are released from stations around the world, usually at noon and midnight Greenwich standard time. As each balloon climbs from the surface to the stratosphere, the temperature is measured and relayed to the ground by radio. While there are more than 1,000 radiosonde launch sites globally, the data from many sites either are not readily available or are not consistently collected. Christy used data from 99 sites at which there has been long-term systematic and reliable data collection. These 99 radiosonde launch sites are in a box bounded by Iceland, Trinidad, Truk Island and Alaska. In an earlier study, an upper air temperature record compiled by NOAA from 63 daily weather balloon sites around the world indicated a 17-year climate trend of -0.05° C per decade, which was in exact agreement with the satellite data at that time, Christy said. GLOBAL COVERAGE One advantage of the MSU dataset is its global coverage. Microwave sounding units aboard NOAA satellites directly measure the temperature of the atmosphere over more than 95 percent of the globe. Each satellite measures the temperature above most points on Earth every 12 hours. The 'global temperature' that has been frequently reported from surface measurements is neither global in extent nor systematic in measurement method. It neglects vast oceanic and continental regions, including Antarctica, the Brazilian rain forests, the Sahara Desert and Greenland. The most commonly cited historical temperature dataset is from ground-based thermometers. More than 5,000 thermometers worldwide provide almost instantaneous local temperature data through links to weather services and scientists. Most of these thermometers, which are usually in small shelters about five feet above the ground, are in areas easily accessible to people. In the U.S. and other industrial countries, these thermometers are most often found at airports. The ground-based network is extensive in North America, Europe, Russia, China and Japan. It is less comprehensive in Africa, South America, Australia and across much of Southern Asia. Temperatures on the surface and vertically through the atmosphere are gathered daily by thermometers carried aloft by helium balloons. ""Radiosonde"" balloons are released from stations around the world, usually at noon and midnight Greenwich standard time. While balloon release sites are scattered throughout the world, they are concentrated in industrial nations. There are more than 1,000 radiosonde launch sites globally. If they were evenly distributed around the world, that would equal approximately one for every 195,000 square miles of the Earth's surface. Water temperatures, which are used to derive estimates of atmospheric temperatures, come from thermometers on piers and buoys, and aboard ""ships of opportunity."" The ships record the temperature of water drawn in to cool their engines. The water temperature data from these instruments is also not global in its coverage, tending instead to be concentrated in heavily-travelled shipping lanes, and in harbors. In the past 12 years, a new system of approximately 100 deep ocean buoys has been established, gathering both atmospheric and water temperature data. INSTRUMENT ACCURACY; MSU With nine satellites measuring the temperature over periods of from one to six years, a method was devised to merge all the data into a single, consistent time series. Each satellite has its own bias that, if not calculated and removed, would introduce spurious trends. The biases are calculated by directly comparing each satellite with others in operation at that time. Periods of overlapping operation ranged from three months to three years, and were sufficient to determine these biases. Because the MSU instruments are so stable and have so many thousands of observations, the biases between the satellites are known to within 0.01 deg. The final product removes these biases so that all data are referenced to a common base. (2) To check the final product, comparisons were made over a 16-year period with balloon measurements as stated above, and the phenomenal agreement provided the independent validation necessary to conclude that the merging technique developed for this dataset was accurate. INSTRUMENT ACCURACY; GROUND-BASED THERMOMETERS Of great concern to scientists is the lack of consistency in the way readings are taken and in the thermometer surroundings. Since most thermometers for which long-term records exist are in towns and cities, the effects of population growth and the construction of nearby roads, parking lots, runways and buildings may cause the temperature to rise a little due of urbanization. This temperature change may be an artifact of a local ""asphalt effect"" rather than a long-term widespread climate change. INSTRUMENT ACCURACY; SHIPS OF OPPORTUNITY While the temperature data collected by ships at sea is reported as a sea surface temperature, this data reflects water temperatures from about three to 60 feet below the surface - the level from which water is drawn into the ships. The thousands of individual thermometers used to collect this data are not calibrated against a scientific standard, nor is there a method for verifying the accuracy of either the thermometers or the reports matching temperature readings to specific times and places. Only in places where there are many overlapping observations can there be any confidence in their accuracy. THE SCIENTISTS In 1996, Spencer and Christy received the American Meteorological Society's Special Award. They were honored ""for developing a global, precise record of the Earth's temperature from operational polar-orbiting satellites, fundamentally advancing our ability to monitor climate."" AMS Special Awards are given to individuals or organizations not appropriately recognized by more specifically-defined awards, and who have made important contributions to the science or practice of meteorology or to the society. In 1991, Spencer and Christy received NASA's Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal. DR.

Rohit Khare <khare@alumni.caltech.edu>,DataPower announces XML-in-silicon,"No analysis yet... don't know what to make of it yet. But here's the raw bits for all to peruse and check out what's really going on... Best, Rohit =========================================================== DataPower delivers XML acceleration device By Scott Tyler Shafer August 27, 2002 5:46 am PT DATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed specifically to process XML data. Unlike competing solutions that process XML data in software, DataPower's device processes the data in hardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance, according to company officials. The new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the first in a family of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based startup. The DataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology called XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML data. According to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future proliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data between two businesses. ""Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure,"" Kelly said. ""The XA35 is the first of a family."" Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up to 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on application servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best alternative. In addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount importance in the world of XML. ""Today's firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,"" Kelly said. ""A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. Firewalls are blind to XML today."" Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on security, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said. According to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the company itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed and security. After trying the software path, the company turned to creating a solution that would process XML in hardware. ""Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,"" said Kelly, adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. Kelly said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with technologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that he believes will be mostly false. Other content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet, while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytes and thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained. The 1U-high network device has been tested against a large collection of XML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language as they pass through the device. The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify and process those packets that are XML, Kelly said. In addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an application co-processor. This deployment method gives administrators more granular control over what data is inspected and the application server itself controls the device. DataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging market. Startup Sarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega XPE switch in May, and earlier this month Tarari, an Intel spin-off, launched with a focus on content processing and acceleration. The DataPower device is now available, priced starting at $54,995. The company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in field trails at a number of other enterprises. ========================================================================= DataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was founded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov, a technology visionary who foresaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols would have on enterprise networks. Long before industry interest in XML grew, Kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class M.I.T. engineers and designed the industry's first solutions to address the unique requirements for processing XML. The first such solution was a software interpreter called DGXT. This software-based approach to XML processing is still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today. Leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from developing software-based accelerators, Kuznetsov's team raised the bar and designed a system for processing XML in purpose-built hardware. In 2001, DataPower's effort produced XML Generation Three (XG3™), the industry's fastest technology for XML processing, bar none. Today, XG3™ technology powers the industry's first wire-speed XML network devices, enabling secure, high-speed applications and XML Web Services. While other companies are just now marketing first versions of products, DataPower is delivering its third generation of technology, providing an immediate return on technology investments to industry-leading customers and partners. DataPower's M.I.T. heritage is complemented by a management team that brings decades of experience in the networking and computing industries, drawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including Akamai, Argon, Cascade, Castle Networks, Sycamore and Wellfleet. ========================================================================= DataPower Technology Secures $9.5 Million in Funding Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed Capital Back Pioneer in XML-Aware Networking for Web Services CAMBRIDGE, Mass. - July 8, 2002 - DataPower Technology, Inc., the leading provider of XML-Aware network infrastructure, today announced that it has secured $9.5 million in series B financing.

I assume that you won't %ghost or remove these and the modules.conf change on uninstall, though. So people who are installing this RPM and are unfortunate enough to have a DVD drive (or just an ordinary CD, non-DVD drive) that doesn't support DMA will be left with a system without a working CD drive, even after removing the RPM. And without ever knowing what struck them. You can't remove the DMA setting from modules.conf either unless you're sure that ogle added it there and nothing else needs it.

Just got a new PC at home - Dell box with Windows XP. Added a second hard disk for Linux. Partitioned the disk and have installed Suse 7.2 from CD, which went fine except it didn't pick up my monitor. I have a Dell branded E151FPp 15"" LCD flat panel monitor and a nVidia GeForce4 Ti4200 video card, both of which are probably too new to feature in Suse's default set. I downloaded a driver from the nVidia website and installed it using RPM. Then I ran Sax2 (as was recommended in some postings I found on the net), but it still doesn't feature my video card in the available list. What next? Another problem. I have a Dell branded keyboard and if I hit Caps-Lock twice, the whole machine crashes (in Linux, not Windows) - even the on/off switch is inactive, leaving me to reach for the power cable instead. If anyone can help me in any way with these probs., I'd be really grateful - I've searched the 'net but have run out of ideas. Or should I be going for a different version of Linux such as RedHat?

Here's a fix that I think will make a real difference. Ftoc_ShowSequences needs to be able to be called with an optional list of msgids to update and if it's called that way it only removes or adds tags for those messages. Then in places like MsgChange, we only update the messages which have changed. Also, a separate Ftoc_ShowSequence function which only updates the display of one sequence should be written which also takes an optional list of msgids. In a place like MsgChange, it would only need to update the cur sequence. If nobody else gets to it, I'll do this when I get back.

However, the additional information won't be required. The opinion could encourage the adoption of text-based political ads, as campaign experts look for new technological ways to sway voters. At the same time, opponents of the plan fear it could lead to anonymous political spam. Target Wireless, a small New Jersey-based wireless media company, had asked the FEC for an opinion on the matter, saying that requiring financial disclosures on short messaging service (SMS) mailings would use up too much of the 160 character-maximum. Political messages on bumper stickers and buttons are also exempt from the financial disclosure requirement. Target Wireless' petition was supported by the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association, and some advertising trade groups. FEC spokesman Bob Biersack said the opinion was in keeping with the commission's policy not to meddle with new technology that has the potential to reach more voters. ""We have tried very hard not to get in the way--particularly before everyone understands how the technology is going to work,"" he said. Opponents of the plan have worried the exemption might encourage spam or allow senders to blast people with mass amounts of negative political messages while remaining anonymous. Biersack said the FEC can revisit the issue if those problems surface. Target Wireless President Craig Krueger characterized the opinion as ""good for America."" ""It will allow people to receive more communication from those running for office,"" he said. ""We have free speech on our side.""",0

aaronsw <rssfeeds@example.com>,to the courthouse,"URL: http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000637 Date: 2002-10-05T21:15:55-06:00 I guess it's time to reveal the incredibly kind invitation I received[1]. As many of you may have found out or guessed, I will be attending oral argument for the Eldred case[2] before the Supreme Court. I'm incredibly excited, as you might imagine. Visiting the Supreme Court would be quite enough, but seeing such an important case...Dayenu! When Lessig asked me if I was free that day to come, I laughed because I couldn't (and still can't) think of anything I'd rather do than attend. I am eternally grateful to Lessig for the chance to attend. On the other hand, I'm sort of embarassed to have the opportunity, when there are surely others who deserve it far more than me. Luckily, it seems that such deserving others will be able to get seats by camping in line with us. So, I'll be arriving in D.C. on Tuesday, attending an Eldred/Duke/EPIC/Bookmobile superparty, and then camping in line with Seth Schoen[3], Lisa Rein, Jace Cooke but unfortunately not Cory Doctorow. If you'd like to come with us, let me know. I was hoping I'd be able to take notes and post them to my weblog for those who couldn't make it, but as I read in today's Times, only lawyers and those with official press credentials are allowed to take notes![4] I think this is outrageous, but hopefully I will be able to remember enough to provide an interesting account. In a related irony, today was ""Disney Day"" at Borders[5], where they played Disney rock songs with the volume turned up too loud, disturbing my usual habit of reading a book there. However, I did manage to skim through _The Practice of Programming_. In an unrelated note, if you haven't been electrocuted by a Model T spark plug, I highly recommend it.

Why is it that people don't understand that giving stuff away is a perfectly acceptable tactic in capitalist businesses? In many places, it's called ""advertising"": ""buy one, get one free"", ""free shipping on any order over $25"", ""buy this couch, and get a coffee table for free"", ""free popcorn with any movie rental"", ""free doorprize to the first 100 people who enter"", ""the author will be signing books (for free) at such and such bookstore"". Access to free stuff often helps to sell other stuff. Just because you (and the entertainment industry, it seems) can't be creative enough to come up with a business model to leverage free stuff into paid stuff... don't take it out on the rest of us.

Martin Adamson <martin@srv0.ems.ed.ac.uk>,[zzzzteana] Hitler-style applicant welcomed by parties,"The Times September 06, 2002 Hitler-style applicant welcomed by parties By Roger Boyes MANAGERS of Germanys political parties are having difficulty explaining their enthusiastic reaction to a man who applied for membership with letters cribbed largely from Mein Kampf, Hitlers personal manifesto. The incident illustrates how indiscriminate parties have become in taking on new members during an election campaign, even when their sentiments bear a suspicious resemblance to those of the Führer. Edmund Stoiber is a thousand times more suited to leading Germany than the present Chancellor, said one letter sent to the Christian Social Union headquarters in Ingolstadt. Chancellor Schröder is doing nothing to stop the flood of foreigners who are spreading around our Fatherland, said the letter, signed by a certain Rudolph Lewald. The CSU immediately spotted a potential member. Many thanks for your nice thoughts, replied the local party manager, who enclosed an application for membership. The letter used chunks of Hitlers book, which is still banned in Germany. History students have to apply for access to the book in university libraries. The strongest, the brave and the hardworking will receive the birthright of existence, only those who are born weaklings could regard this as offensive, the letter-writer said. So-called humanity is melting like snow in the March sun. Such phrases were lifted from Mein Kampf, which was written while Hitler was in jail after the failed Munich putsch of 1923. Similar letters, also using the Nazi leaders words, were sent to the other political parties and drew sympathetic responses. I read your letter with great interest and pleasure, the manager of the Christian Democratic Union in Cologne, said. Great that you want to join us! enthused the Green Party headquarters. The Free Democrats invited the aspiring party member to a fundraising charity ball at which Hans- Dietrich Genscher, the former Foreign Minister, would be the star guest. The Social Democrats sent a list of rallies to be attended by Gerhard Schröder, the Chancellor. I wanted to test how serious parties are about combating right-wing extremism, said the letter-writer, who was in fact the Cologne novelist Rainer Popp. I had no idea that they would be so enthusiastic. For the first few days I expected two men in leather coats from the Special Branch to knock on my door. Instead only the postman called  with packets of election material from zealous political headquarters, Herr Popp said. I was stunned that political parties could react in this way  I reckon I would have had the same response if I had signed the letter Adolf Hitler. ------------------------ Yahoo!

boingboing <rssfeeds@example.com>,My talk at UT Austin,"URL: http://boingboing.net/#85505995 Date: Not supplied I've been in Austin all weekend. On Friday, I spoke at the University of Texas about EFF issues. Jon Lebkowsky was there -- hell, he organized it -- and he blogged the hell out of the talk: Entertainment industry has tradition of attacking technology: the piano roll, the radio (sued by vaudeville), television (would destroy cinema!), ""the Betamax affair""... the latter being the first consumer VCR. In Betamax case, argued that the ability to make a full copy of a broadcast work would not be a fair use (in terms of copyright). It was illegal enough that the VCR should be kept off the market, they argued. The Supreme Court got the case, and the thing that shook out of it was the Betamax principle: a technology is legal so long as it has substantial non-infringeing uses. This principle is under attack. Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 1998. Illegal to defeat a copyright measure. Regionalization system for DVDs. This is a control that limits distribution. John Johansen in Norway figured out how to break the content scrambling system and allows you to move from one region to another, override copy protection. It was called DeCSS - Johansen is facing trial for creating a piece of code.

John Hall <johnhall@evergo.net>,Pluck and Luck,"Anyone who doesn't appreciate both PLUCK and LUCK is only looking at part of the equation. America has, in fact, moved hard toward Meritocracy. But -- and this is a huge one -- you don't necessarily find it on the Forbes list. There is an element of LUCK, even if only being in the right place at the right time, to go that high. Beyond the Forbes List, there are many ways in which almost pure LUCK is involved in significant wealth. Being a super-model, for example. Though I think most people would be surprised by a lot of super-models. Cindy Crawford was valedictorian of her high school. Most people, of course, aren't in those stratified realms. It is the rest of us who tend to sort. There is a huge philosophical problem with the concept of Merit in the first place. Rawls claims Merit doesn't exist. Sowell seems to agree at least in part, but I'm sure Sowell would also state that the benefits of pretending it exists for society at large are enormous. And if Merit does exist then exactly what is it measuring? IQ? Purity of heart? Or the ability to satisfy customers? Functionally most people seem to equate Merit with IQ though they say it would be better if it were purity of heart. Yet the type of Merit that lands you on the Forbes list, or even just being a garden variety 'millionaire next door' is more likely to be the 'serving customers' definition. Differences due to merit, when they are perceived as such, generate far more animosity than differences due to luck. Luck can be forgiven.

The work currently being done on the GA, and comparing different methods of doing the score-setting, is very worthwhile, and extremely useful; however, we really ought to get a release out, since 2.31 is getting decreasingly useful as time goes on. The FP/FN rate of 2.40 with pretty well *any* score-setting mechanism will be better than 2.31 -- we can continue with adjusting how the scores are set on the 2.41 or 2.50 branches.

Tim Chapman <timc@2ubh.com>,[zzzzteana] Nobel astrophysicists,"Nobel Honors 3 for Astrophysics Work Tuesday October 8, 2002 12:00 PM STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) - Two Americans and a Japanese won the Nobel Prize in physics Tuesday for using some of the most obscure particles and waves in nature to understand the workings of astronomy's grandest wonders. Riccardo Giacconi, 71, of the Associated Universities Inc. in Washington, D.C., will get half of the $1 million prize for his role in ``pioneering contributions to astrophysics, which have led to the discovery of cosmic X-ray sources.'' Raymond Davis, Jr., 87, of the University of Pennsylvania shares the other half of the prize with Japanese scientist Masatoshi Koshiba, 76, of the University of Tokyo. The two men pioneered the construction of giant underground chambers to detect neutrinos, elusive particles that stream from the sun by the billion. Neutrinos offer an unparalleled view of the sun's inner workings because they are produced in its heart by the same process that causes it to shine. In fact, Davis' early experiments, performed during the 1960s in a South Dakota gold mine, confirmed that the sun is powered by nuclear fusion. Koshiba won his share of the prize for his work at the Kamiokande neutrino detector in Japan. That experiment confirmed and extended Davis' work, and also discovered neutrinos coming from distant supernova explosions, some of the brightest objects in the universe. The Italian-born Giacconi, a U.S. citizen, was awarded half of the prize for building the first X-ray telescopes that provided ``completely new - and sharp - images of the universe,'' the academy said. His research laid the foundation for X-ray astronomy, which has led to the discovery of black holes and allowed researchers to peer deep into the hearts of the dusty young galaxies where stars are born. When academy officials reached Giacconi by phone at his home outside Washington, he said he was ``dumbstruck'' to learn of the prize. Koshiba also was phoned at home in Tokyo, but the academy was still trying to reach Davis, spokesman Erling Norrby said. This year's Nobel awards started Monday with the naming of Britons Sydney Brenner, 75, and Sir John E. Sulston, 60, and American H. Robert Horvitz, 55, as winners of the medicine prize, selected by a committee at the Karolinska Institute. The researchers shared it for discoveries about how genes regulate organ growth and a process of programmed cell deaths that shed light on how viruses and bacteria invade human cells, including in conditions such as AIDS, strokes, cancer and heart attacks. The winner of the Nobel Prize in chemistry will be named on Wednesday morning and the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel later the same day. The literature prize winner will be announced on Thursday, the Swedish Academy said on Tuesday. The winner of the coveted peace prize - the only one not awarded in Sweden - will be announced Friday in Oslo, Norway. The award committees make their decisions in deep secrecy and candidates are not publicly revealed for 50 years. Alfred Nobel, the wealthy Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite who endowed the prizes left only vague guidelines for the selection committees. In his will he said the prize being revealed on Tuesday should be given to those who ``shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind'' and ``shall have made the most important discovery or invention within the field of physics.'' The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which also chooses the chemistry and economics winners, invited nominations from previous recipients and experts in the fields before cutting down its choices. Deliberations are conducted in strict secrecy. The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death in 1896, in Stockholm and in Oslo. ---",0
UW Email Robot <pine-robot@docserver.cac.washington.edu>,The MIME information you requested (last changed 3154 Feb 14),"-------------------------------------------------------------------------- What is MIME? MIME stands for ""Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions"". It is the standard for how to send multipart, multimedia, and binary data using the world-wide Internet email system. Typical uses of MIME include sending images, audio, wordprocessing documents, programs, or even plain text files when it is important that the mail system does not modify any part of the file. MIME also allows for labelling message parts so that a recipient (or mail program) may determine what to do with them. How can I read a MIME message? Since MIME is only a few years old, there are still some mailers in use which do not understand MIME messages. However, there are a growing number of mail programs that have MIME support built-in. (One popular MIME-capable mailer for Unix, VMS and PCs is Pine, developed at the University of Washington and available via anonymous FTP from the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the file /pine/pine.tar.Z) In addition, several proprietary email systems provide MIME translation capability in their Internet gateway products. However, even if you do not have access to a MIME-capable mailer or suitable gateway, there is still hope! There are a number of stand-alone programs that can interpret a MIME message. One of the more versatile is called ""munpack"". It was developed at Carnegie Mellon University and is available via anonymous FTP from the host ftp.andrew.cmu.edu in the directory pub/mpack/. There are versions available for Unix, PC, Mac and Amiga systems. For compabibility with older forms of transferring binary files, the munpack program can also decode messages in split-uuencoded format. Does MIME replace UUENCODE? Yes. UUENCODE has been used for some time for encoding binary files so that they can be sent via Internet mail, but it has several technical limitations and interoperability problems. MIME uses a more robust encoding called ""Base64"" which has been carefully designed to survive the message transformations made by certain email gateways. How can I learn more about MIME? The MIME Internet standard is described in RFC-1521, available via anonymous FTP from many different Internet hosts, including: o US East Coast Address: ds.internic.net (198.49.45.10) o US West Coast Address: ftp.isi.edu (128.9.0.32) o Pacific Rim Address: munnari.oz.au (128.250.1.21) o Europe Address: nic.nordu.net (192.36.148.17) Look for the file /rfc/rfc1521.txt Another source of information is the Internet news group ""comp.mail.mime"", which includes a periodic posting of a ""Frequently Asked Questions"" list. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",0

This is far from the first time Bush has been made the butt of a jibe meant to showcase what some perceive as his less than stellar intellectual abilities. Without straining our memories too hard, we can come up with three other instances we've chronicled on this site. In the summer of 2001, the joke of the moment centered upon a supposed study that had resulted in the ranking of Presidential IQs, with George W. Bush being pegged as the Chief Executive who scraped the bottom of the intelligence barrel. In December 2000 it was a fake Nostradamus quatrain which pontificated that the ""village idiot"" would win the 2000 Presidential election. And in the spring of 2002, it was the story of Bush's waving at Stevie Wonder that set folks to chortling up their sleeves. Stories that illustrate this widely believed intellectual shortcoming will always waft after George W. Bush because they seemingly confirm what many already hold as true about this public figure, that he's not the brightest fellow that's ever been. It is human nature to revel in yarns that the hearer at some level agrees with, thus tales of this sort will always fall upon appreciative ears.

skip@pobox.com,[Spambayes] Deployment,"Guido> Takers? How is ESR's bogofilter packaged? SpamAssassin? The Guido> Perl Bayes filter advertised on slashdot? Dunno about the other tools, but SpamAssassin is a breeze to incorporate into a procmail environment. Lots of people use it in many other ways. For performance reasons, many people run a spamd process and then invoke a small C program called spamc which shoots the message over to spamd and passes the result back out. I think spambayes in incremental mode is probably fast enough to not require such tricks (though I would consider changing the pickle to an anydbm file). Basic procmail usage goes something like this: :0fw | spamassassin -P :0 * ^X-Spam-Status: Yes $SPAM Which just says, ""Run spamassassin -P reinjecting its output into the processing stream. If the resulting mail has a header which begins ""X-Spam-Status: Yes"", toss it into the folder indicated by the variable $SPAM. SpamAssassin also adds other headers as well, which give you more detail about how its tests fared. I'd like to see spambayes operate in at least this way: do its thing then return a message to stdout with a modified set of headers which further processing downstream can key on. Skip",0

Even then, those relics were well on their way from bargain bins to the dust bin of PC history. Since then, few if any new computers have sold for less than $200. Any that did were seriously outdated or inoperable. Now, in a challenge to established tech giants, several upstarts have banded together to create a PC that retails for $199.86. It doesn't do Windows. In fact, it doesn't do a lot of things. The Microtel SYSMAR710, sold only at Wal-Mart's online store, runs on a Linux operating system variant called Lindows, which has been hyped as a new choice for consumers who want to break away from the Microsoft monopoly. ... - http://finance.lycos.com/home/news/story.asp?story=28928829",0

Rohit Khare <khare@alumni.caltech.edu>,"""A billion here, a billion there...""","> Bottom line: the late Senate Minority Leader certainly would have > endorsed the meaning behind the phrase, but it is questionable that he > ever coined it. An interesting link courtesy of the Harrow Report: there's no written evidence so far that Senator Everett Dirksen is the source of the infamous quote attributed to him. It's kind of astounding that there is enough general social consensus (25% of all queries makes it a *very* FAQ) and ""eyewitness"" reporting without a single written source. What the essay below doesn't seem to answer, though, is what the earliest attributed quote in print by any other writer is. I'd naturally be much more skeptical if the ""quote"" emerged after his death... RK =============================================================== http://www.dirksencenter.org/featuresBillionHere.htm ""A billion here, a billion there . . ."" Did Dirksen ever say, "" A billion here, a billion there, and pretty soon you're talking real money""? (or anything very close to that?) Perhaps not. Based on an exhaustive search of the paper and audio records of The Dirksen Congressional Center, staffers there have found no evidence that Dirksen ever uttered the phrase popularly attributed to him. Archivists undertook the search after studying research statistics showing that more than 25 percent of inquiries have to do with the quote or its variations. Here is what they examined: all of the existing audio tapes of the famed ""Ev and Charlie"" and ""Ev and Jerry"" shows, all newspapers clippings in the Dirksen Papers, about 12,500 pages of Dirksen's own speech notes, transcripts of his speeches and media appearances, transcripts of Republican leadership press conferences, and Dirksen's statements on the Senate floor as documented in the Congressional Record. Although Dirksen rarely prepared the text of a speech, preferring to rely on notes, he did employ brief phrases to remind him of a particular turn of phrase. For example, in referring to the public debt or excessive government spending, Dirksen would jot the word ""pothole"" to remind him to tell the following story, on this occasion in reference to the debt ceiling: ""As I think of this bill, and the fact that the more progress we make the deeper we go into the hole, I am reminded of a group of men who were working on a street.

Max Dunn <maxdunn@siliconpublishing.com>,"RE: OSCOM Berkeley report: Xopus, Bitflux, Plone, Xoops","I attended the same conference, and was impressed by a few systems that Jim didn't mention. In terms of CMS, the following all had apparently been used in some fairly large implementations and looked like some pretty strong competition to commercial systems: - Midgard, http://www.midgard-project.org/ , a PHP-based content management framework that with other programs combines to be a full CMS - Redhat CCM CMS, Java-based: http://www.example.com/software/ccm/cms/ - OpenCMS, Java-based: http://www.opencms.org There was agreement that usability has not generally been an open source strength, but both Plone and Xopus represented some real movement towards improving that situation. I was impressed by the spectrum of perspectives on XML. Some took for granted that XSLT was relevant to content management, others took it just as for granted that XSLT was irrelevant and seemed happy to ignore XML almost completely. I attended realizing that ""content management"" is generally used to apply to *Web* content management, but I was still a bit shocked how completely out of scope document management was (almost no consideration of the potential print/PDF dimension to content other than the occasional ""...and you can use FOP to make PDF"" as if that was functional): this seems more the case in open source content management than in commercial content management, and probably makes XML easier to ignore (if HTML is the be-all and end-all of the output...). The honesty was refreshing, Phil Suh complained about the state of current tools (both open source and commercial), and I wish I'd written down what he said, something like ""it sucks so extremely, it sucks so widely, and it is so generally sucking, that it seems sometimes there is no hope."" For a moment there was contemplation that perhaps commercial systems scaled so well that the commercial ""big boys"" were really much more functional than open source, until someone pointed out, ""OK, take some average blog software, spend $500,000 on the rollout... it'll scale pretty well."" Another quote (citing Brendan Quinn): ""content management problems are either trivial or impossible."" Mac OS X is getting popular, of the laptops there it was an even 1/3 each of Mac, Linux, Windows. I am sure it wasn't news to Jim, but I can't wait to try Subversion, a CVS replacement that supports some of the newer features of WebDAV: http://subversion.tigris.org/ I'm also eager to try Xopus, I hope the developers make it back home safely, they said they'd only been in America four days but were already homeless...

I was getting sick of hearing about geeks breeding and ending up with autistic children - proving that intelligence is a genetic defect and a ""do not breed"" flag.) - Adam L. ""Duncan"" Beberg http://www.mithral.com/~beberg/ beberg@mithral.com ----------------- Tech's Major Decline College Students Turning Away From Bits and Bytes By Ellen McCarthy Washington Post Staff Writer Tuesday, August 27, 2002; Page E01 If John Yandziak had been entering college a few years ago, he might have sought a stake in the ""new"" economy. He might have dreamed of becoming an ace code-cracker for the CIA or the National Security Agency, or imagined toppling an empire with revolutionary software. Maybe he would have tried to use the Internet to end world hunger. But as Yandziak attends his first college classes this week, he's harboring different academic ambitions. The Ashburn native says he wants to do something more social and more interesting than working with computers. Besides, he said while packing for a Charlottesville dormitory room, ""you can't get the chicks with that anymore."" The tech industry's financial problems are enough to bankrupt the dreams of some fair-weather students. But now there's another consequence of the tech bust: Enrollment growth in undergraduate computer science departments has come to a halt. The number of undergraduates majoring in computer science fell 1 percent in 2001, according to a report by the Computing Research Association. And educators in the field say the trend seems to be accelerating, with some colleges seeing much greater drops as the new academic year begins. The word is out among department deans that the bust's fallout has trickled into the classroom, said Maria Clavez, president of the Association of Computing Machinery. ""I've heard everything from no change to modest decline to more dramatic declines,"" said Clavez, who will become the dean of science and engineering at Princeton University in January. ""It can be hard to see this, because at some colleges the number of people who want to study computer science so far exceeds the available space. [But] it is going to have an effect."" At Virginia Tech, enrollment of undergraduates in the computer science department will drop 25 percent this year, to 300. At George Washington University, the number of incoming freshmen who plan to study computer science fell by more than half this year. Interest in undergraduate computer science programs had grown rapidly in the past decade. In 1997, schools with PhD programs in computer science and computer engineering granted 8,063 degrees, according to the Computing Research Association. The numbers rose through 2001, when 17,048 degrees were awarded. The Labor Department projects that software engineering will be the fastest-growing occupation between 2000 and 2010, with other computer-related industries trailing close behind. But in the short term that growth may slow, based on the changes among college students. For example, 900 of the 2,000-plus undergraduates studying information technology and engineering at George Mason University were computer science majors last year. This year the enrollment in that major is down to 800, although a newly created and more general information technology major has attracted 200 students. ""Having it ease off for a while is a bit of a relief,"" said Lloyd Griffith, dean of George Mason's information technology and engineering school. ""Particularly with the field as it has been, they don't want to spend four years on something and then not get a job."" Freshman enrollment for the University of Maryland's computer science major is expected to be about 167 this fall, down from 329 last year. Maryland decreased its total freshman enrollment by 11 percent, but that alone does not account for the drop, said Steve Halperin, dean of Maryland's College of Computer, Mathematical and Physical Sciences. ""We are seeing a decrease in the number of freshmen who are declaring their interest in pursuing computer science as a major,"" Halperin said. ""That's a factual statement. But I would say that at this point . . . we don't expect to see a decrease in the number of graduates. Many of the kids who are no longer expressing an interest in majoring in CS would have fallen off."" Yandziak, who began at the University of Virginia on Saturday, is not convinced that's the case. He graduated in the top 5 percent of his class, with a 3.9 grade-point average, and nailed the highest possible score on his advanced-placement exam in computer science. ""All of my classes have been easy for me. Math and sciences were always fun, so I looked for professions in which I could use those things,"" Yandziak said. ""I'm just not sure I want my life to be immersed in [technology]. I want to do something that will contribute to the practical world."" Harris N. Miller, president of the Information Technology Association of America, said the last time there was a dearth of computing professionals, salaries skyrocketed and workers benefited from the labor shortage. ""There was a tremendous imbalance in the late '90s; potentially you have the same sort of thing going on right now. People are saying, 'I don't need this kind of IT training right now,' "" Miller said. ""Our concern as an industry is that if they begin to again see major declines in enrollment, down the road four years, as the economy picks up, once again companies are going to find themselves in a shortage situation."" Economic potential weighs heavily in many student career choices, but other factors, including program difficulty, personal interests and social influences, also come into play, said Judy Hingle, director of professional development at the American College Counseling Association. The perception of computer science as an isolating, ""nerdy"" profession is one that many in the industry have tried to squelch. That stereotype went underground during the tech bubble but reemerged during the bust. ""All the hipness is gone,"" Yandziak said. ""Once we thought of the Internet as this thing with infinite capabilities. It was basically just a fad that came along."" Lamont Thompson, a recent graduate of Calvin Coolidge Senior High School in the District, is headed to Morehouse College in Atlanta to study business marketing, with the intention of going into real estate development. ""Technology comes natural to people my age; it's not fascinating anymore,"" Thompson said. ""To be honest with you, when I think computer science, I think of some guy sitting behind a computer all day in a dark room. It's a necessity, but I wouldn't take it any further.""",0

I've got Debian with kernel 2.4.18. I've got this Win-Modem(yes, I know) and managed to locate a proper driver for it. Minicom is very much able to dial out. But there seems to be a problem with my PPPD installation. When I type 'ppp' in the minicom terminal, all I get (after the initial info of my dynamic IP, etc) is a ~ and then the NO CARRIER signal. Then I looked into calling pppd directly using chat. I used this command: pppd call Provider (where Provider is some script somewhere). It dials, it connects, it sends my username & password, and when connection is established, it gives the SIGHUP signal and exits. This is confirmed when me friend and I tried to connect through a serial port using pppd to connect ttyS0. I ran pppd waiting for a connection, me friend tried connecting and as soon as he did, pppd exited. Some expert help would be greatly appreciated as I'm sick and tired of having to reboot, get into Windoze to hook up to the net and then back to Linux, mounting this drive to get that file, etc. It'd be nice never have to go back to Windoze(except for games, that is).

boingboing <rssfeeds@example.com>,Mathematics film-festival in October in Berkeley,"URL: http://boingboing.net/#85516333 Date: Not supplied All through October, Berkeley's Mathematical Sciences Research Institute is hosting Cinemath, a mathematics film festival: Permutations and Configurations: A Calculated Cinema In this avant-garde subset of Cinemath, we explore films that have been constructed using mathematical concepts both simple and complex- geometric permutations, musical frameworks, even topography are among the strategies that have been employed to compose and sequence film frames. Filmmakers such as Oskar Fischinger and Walther Ruttmann created some of the earliest avant-garde films by multiplying, dividing, and otherwise transforming abstract images- including spirals, rectangles, and circles to produce dynamic rhythms and harmonies. Today such visual music and motion graphics are the currency of digital graphics. Anthony McCall's film performances such as Line Describing a Cone create 3-D geometric shapes into which the viewer can literally step. We also explore films by pioneers of machine-generated and computer-produced animation (Norman McLaren, James and John Whitney, Stan Vanderbeek) as well as works by contemporary animators who use the computer to either generate or pattern images (Larry Cuba, Paul Glabicki, James Otis). Peter Kubelka, Taka Iimura, and Standish Lawder use the frame as the unit with which they create editing patterns, while Kurt Kren and Paul Sharits reckon on arithmetic systems to variously calculate compositional or editing patterns. Bette Gordon, Hollis Frampton, and Bruce Elder figure in algorithms, group theory, and set theory to graphically enliven the frame or to structure their films. While no mathematical knowledge is required to enjoy these films, we count on you to try to calculate the mathematical systems employed!

Certainly not Christianity, Islam, etc. B) ""How it is currently being expressed"" amounts to a tacit acknowledgement that the sophistication of the society involved and people's self-limiting reasonableness are important to avoid primitive expression. This leads to the point that religion and less sophisticated societies are a dangerous mix. It also tends to invoke the image of extremes that might occur without diligent maintenance of society. C) Many splinter Christianity religions have 'clean hands' but they also aren't 'found in the wild'. (By ""primitive expression"", I don't mean to slight any society, but that there is some chronic evidence of irrational mob actions and uncivilized behavior (killing infants, women to break religious blue laws, etc.). The US has only really been mostly free of ""primitive expression"" for 40-50 years, although large categories, including serious religious conflict, were settled quite a while ago.) D) The Northern Ireland Protestant vs. Catholic feud, recently more or less concluded, is not completely unlike this kind of friction generated by splitting society too much along religious lines. One Post article pointed out that the problem basically stemmed from the vertical integration of areas along religious lines all the way to schools, government, political party, etc. (Of course both cases have a heritage of British conquest, but who doesn't?)

About 54 percent of the population is Protestant, and most Protestants are unionists who want the province to remain part of Britain. The Roman Catholic minority is predominantly republican, or nationalist; they want to merge with the Republic of Ireland to the south. In 1968, Catholic leaders launched a civil rights drive modeled on the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s campaign in the American South. But violence quickly broke out, with ancient religious animosities fueling the political argument. Armed paramilitary groups sprung up on both sides. Police records and historians agree that the most lethal group by far was the IRA, fighting on the Catholic side with a goal of a united Ireland The provincial police force estimates that about 3,600 people were killed during the 30-year conflict known, with characteristic Northern Ireland understatement, as ""The Troubles.""' >2.

Ximian GNOME Security Team <distribution@ximian.com>,[Ximian Updates] Hyperlink handling in Gaim allows arbitrary code to be executed,"Severity: Security Product: gaim Keywords: gaim hyperlink manual References: CAN-2002-0989 http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-0989 Gaim Changelog http://gaim.sourceforge.net/ChangeLog Gaim is an instant messaging client based on the published TOC protocol from AOL. The developers of Gaim, an instant messenger client that combines several different networks, found a vulnerability in the hyperlink handling code. The 'Manual' browser command passes an untrusted string to the shell without escaping or reliable quoting, permitting an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the users machine. Unfortunately, Gaim doesn't display the hyperlink before the user clicks on it. Users who use other inbuilt browser commands aren't vulnerable. The fixed version of Gaim no longer passes the user's manual browser command to the shell. Commands which contain the %s in quotes will need to be amended, so they don't contain any quotes. The 'Manual' browser command can be edited in the 'General' pane of the 'Preferences' dialog, which can be accessed by clicking 'Options' from the login window, or 'Tools' and then 'Preferences' from the menu bar in the buddy list window. Please download Gaim 0.59.1 or later using Red Carpet. You may also obtain this update from the Ximian FTP site.

Look at he life expectancy and human carrying capacity of this continent before the Europeans got here. Look at it now. Even for descendants of the original inhabitants. Even for the descendents of slaves, who were brought here by force. More stuff, cheaper. That's progress. Poverty, of course, is not relative. It's absolute. Disparity in wealth has nothing to do with it. It's like saying that groups have rights, when, in truth, only individuals do. Like group rights, ""disparity"" in wealth is statistical sophistry. Besides, even if you can't help the distribution, industrial wealth is almost always transitory, and so is relative poverty, even when there are no confiscatory death-taxes. The 20th anniversary Forbes 400 just came out, and only a few tens of people are still there since 1982, a time which had significantly higher marginal taxes on wealth, income, and inheritance than we do now. More to the point, they're nowhere near the top. I'll take those odds. It is only when neofeudalism reasserts itself, in the form of government regulation, confiscatory taxes, legislated monopoly, corporate welfare, ""non-profit"" neoaristocratic tax dodges, and legalized labor extortion that we get slowdowns in progress, like what happened in Fabian-era Britain, or 1970's USA. In fact, it is in countries where wealth is the most ""unfairly"" distributed, that you get the most improvement in the general -- economic -- welfare. More stuff cheaper, fewer people dying, more people living longer. I'll take those odds as well. People take greater risks when the returns are higher, improving the lot of us all as a result.

Some of my spamtrap data had a few 1's contributed by ISPs, and I hadn't spent enough time sifting for legit mail that was slipping through. So I felt better leaving them out for this run, apart from what I'd hand-cleaned. --j.",0

So I'm not > about to place blame. Just reporting my experience. One more salvo on X and cut/paste. X specifies at least two *mechanisms* for cut/paste, but as usual mandates no *policy*. Windows and Macintosh have a slightly different mechanism and one uniform policy. I'm quite sure that Tk implements all PRIMARY and CLIPBOARD selections accurately. The PRIMARY selection is the one that is tied to the visible selection on your X display. The CLIPBOARD selection is the one with the explicit Copy step, and is the same as what you have on Windows and Macintosh. However, exmh throws in support for the cutbuffer mechanism, which is another archaic mechanism supported at one point (perhaps still today) by versions of emacs. Exmh has a policy that tries to unify all these mechanisms under one umbrella, and by all reports it is not that great. I would encourage folks to play with those 10 lines of code in Text_Selection and report what works well for them. We may come up with 8 lines that work for everyone, or perhaps introduce yet another setting that lets folks choose between a few useful models. Of course, that's an admission of policy failure, but I'm willing to do that. -- Brent Welch Software Architect, Panasas Inc Pioneering the World's Most Scalable and Agile Storage Network www.panasas.com welch@panasas.com _______________________________________________ Exmh-users mailing list Exmh-users@redhat.com https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-users",0

The actual follow-up to the Xing player break was more interesting than that. The mere knowledge of known plaintext (a corresponding input and output) does not necessarily make it trivial to break a properly designed systems and/or algorithm. The primary reason it was easy for CSS is because the CSS key was only 40-bits, and thereby easy to break with exhaustive search attacks. It was only 40-bits (speculated) because of a misunderstanding of the government cryptography export rules at the time. Even more interesting, to me at least, was that soon after the Xing player break, people started studying the CSS algorithm itself. They rapidly found serious design flaws which left the 40-bit CSS algorithm with an actual strength of around 23-bits (from memory, and new attacks might have further reduced the strength).

Hettinga"" <rah@shipwright.com>",High-Altitude Rambos,"http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/23/opinion/23HERB.html?todaysheadlines=&pagewanted=print&position=top The New York Times September 23, 2002 High-Altitude Rambos By BOB HERBERT Dr. Bob Rajcoomar, a U.S. citizen and former military physician from Lake Worth, Fla., found himself handcuffed and taken into custody last month in one of the many episodes of hysteria to erupt on board airliners in the U.S. since the Sept. 11 attacks. Dr. Rajcoomar was seated in first class on a Delta Airlines flight from Atlanta to Philadelphia on Aug. 31 when a passenger in the coach section began behaving erratically. The passenger, Steven Feuer, had nothing to do with Dr. Rajcoomar. Two U.S. air marshals got up from their seats in first class and moved back to coach to confront Mr. Feuer, who was described by witnesses as a slight man who seemed disoriented. What ensued was terrifying. When Mr. Feuer refused to remain in his seat, the marshals reacted as if they were trying out for the lead roles in Hollywood's latest action extravaganza. They handcuffed Mr. Feuer, hustled him into first class and restrained him in a seat next to Dr. Rajcoomar. The 180 or so passengers were now quite jittery. Dr. Rajcoomar asked to have his seat changed and a flight attendant obliged, finding him another seat in first class. The incident, already scary, could - and should - have ended there. But the marshals were not ready to let things quiet down. One of the marshals pulled a gun and brandished it at the passengers. The marshals loudly demanded that all passengers remain in their seats, and remain still. They barked a series of orders. No one should stand for any reason. Arms and legs should not extend into the aisles. No one should try to visit the restroom. The message could not have been clearer: anyone who disobeyed the marshals was in danger of being shot. The passengers were petrified, with most believing that there were terrorists on the plane. ""I was afraid there was going to be a gun battle in that pressurized cabin,"" said Senior Judge James A. Lineberger of the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas, a veteran of 20 years in the military, who was sitting in an aisle seat in coach. ""I was afraid that I was going to die from the gunfire in a shootout."" Dr. Rajcoomar's wife, Dorothy, who was seated quite a distance from her husband, said, ""It was really like Rambo in the air."" She worried that there might be people on the plane who did not speak English, and therefore did not understand the marshals' orders. If someone got up to go to the bathroom, he or she might be shot. There were no terrorists on board. There was no threat of any kind. When the plane landed about half an hour later, Mr. Feuer was taken into custody. And then, shockingly, so was Dr. Rajcoomar. The air marshals grabbed the doctor from behind, handcuffed him and, for no good reason that anyone has been able to give, hauled him to an airport police station where he was thrown into a filthy cell. This was airline security gone berserk. No one ever suggested that Dr. Rajcoomar, a straight-arrow retired Army major, had done anything wrong. Dr. Rajcoomar, who is of Indian descent, said he believes he was taken into custody solely because of his brown skin. He was held for three frightening hours and then released without being charged. Mr. Feuer was also released. Officials tried to conceal the names of the marshals, but they were eventually identified by a Philadelphia Inquirer reporter as Shawn B. McCullers and Samuel Mumma of the Transportation Security Administration, which is part of the U.S. Transportation Department. The Transportation Security Administration has declined to discuss the incident in detail. A spokesman offered the absurd explanation that Dr. Rajcoomar was detained because he had watched the unfolding incident ""too closely."" If that becomes a criterion for arrest in the U.S., a lot of us reporters are headed for jail. Dr. Rajcoomar told me yesterday that he remains shaken by the episode. ""I had never been treated like that in my life,"" he said. ""I was afraid that I was about to be beaten up or killed."" Lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union have taken up his case and he has filed notice that he may sue the federal government for unlawful detention. ""We have to take a look at what we're doing in the name of security,"" said Dr. Rajcoomar. ""So many men and women have fought and died for freedom in this great country, and now we are in danger of ruining that in the name of security."" -- ----------------- R. A.

Sure! I think it's relevant, but maybe for another purpose.

Oh thats right Greg. Because was explicitly clear that the pro-Bush folks went out and did the permit dance. So where in the article is this again? Lets get something straight here. This -is- a First Amendment issue. Public streets, provided one isn't blocking traffic, generally tend to be sorta ok, at least from my last interpretation of Con Law a few years ago (I'll feign ignorance wrt the fact that laws may have changed, and the specific facts in this case are weak). IF this guy _was_ merely holding a sign (which it seems was the case for all the pro-bush folks) he did nothing wrong. He certainly didn't do enough of a wrong to warrant a disorderly conduct charge. I'll play with your perspective though. Lets assume a few things. If I walk into the city office and tell them I want to peacably assemble against Bush, do you think they'll give me a permit? Probably not. So I lie. Then the cop does what happened in this scenario. HE walks up, checks my permit and finds out that I falsified my statement to get this said document. He arrests me. End of story.

Muddied my ass. How hard is it to chose between a Republocrat or a Demipublican? Not very. Shouting down has grown to become the answer because the government, over a span of years, and with the help of the Courts -has- limited the rights we have as citizens under the First Amendment. If you question the policy about terrorism, or drugs, or Iraq, or Bush in general, you're aiding terrorism. If you challenge the beliefs of the folks attending the various shadowy G8 conferences, you're an anarchist, and you're herded off to a 'designated protest spot' miles away from anything. Part of the point of speech is to be -heard-. I can scream on my soapbox in the forest somewhere, and while thats speech, its not effective speech. People are screaming and shouting over the political figures because they cannot be heard in any other way.

Getting back to my original point. How do you communicate an idea to an unknown audience, if you're miles from where the audience is? How do you bypass the rules for being -miles- away from the audience without violating the rules of the regime? I don't think Mr. Nell was throwing pies at Bush. A sign, the last time I checked, didn't cause physical injury, or even emotional harm. If I remember Cohen v. California, 403 U.S. 15 (1971), its not the individual speaking that has the requirement to desist, but the individual listening who has the option to leave. Just my .02, while its still considered legal. -- Best regards, bitbitch mailto:bitbitch@magnesium.net",0

"""James C. McMaster (Jim)"" <mcmasjc@tatanka.stortek.com>",Re: From,"This is not an exmh problem, but an interaction between sendmail, Solaris and mh. Your sysadmin is wrong. It is the responsibility of the receiving mail server to escape lines beginning with ""From "" if they choose to turn on that facility. It is not the responsibility for email clients to cater to the stupid design of the unix mail spool, and Sun's even more stupid decision to rely on ""Content-length:"" instead of dealing with this problem. Since mh is unaware of ""Content-length:"", rcvstore gags trying to parse messages from the spool. I had this same problem. There are several ways to fix it: 1) Get your mail administrator to add the ""E"" flag to your sendmail. This means you will never see a line beginning with ""From "". Any such line will look like "">From "". 2) There is a patch to mh to make it respect ""Content-length:"". When I was having this problem, porting this patch to nmh was low on the priority list, then nmh development stalled for a long time. I doubt it has been done, but you can check with the nmh list at nmh-workers@mhost.com to find out for sure. 3) You can learn to use procmail, invoking rcvstore directly instead of letting sendmail put your incoming mail into the spool. This avoids the whole issue. rcvstore only deals with a single message at a time, and everything works. -- Jim McMaster mailto:mcmasjc@tatanka.stortek.com In message <200210091657.g99GvDmX025433@life.ai.mit.edu>, Jason Rennie said: > > When I receive a message that has a line starting with ""From "", it's > broken into two messages.

With the Waldseemuller map, the New World was born. But there was something else. What would later come to be called South America and Central America were surprisingly well-shaped, not only on the east coast, where explorers had already sailed, but also on the west coast -- which no European was known to have seen. The ice cream cone bulge that sticks out into the Pacific at the junction of modern-day Chile and Peru is readily visible and in almost exactly the right geographical spot -- not only in the main map, but also in an inset printed along its top. The shape of South America in the main map appears distorted because of the curvature of the Earth. It is an improbable coincidence, if it was a coincidence, for the map -- 12 large printed pages to be arrayed in one 36-square-foot wall display -- was published six years before Vasco Balboa's 1513 trip across the Isthmus of Panama and 12 years before Ferdinand Magellan's 1519-22 trip around the world.

I'm working with an experimental text recognition/processing engine that exhibits similar characteristics. It can read right through misspellings like the above without any difficulty. And as the author above suggested, the pattern matching is inherently parallel internally. If the text recognition algorithm/architecture humans use is anything like the algorithm/structure we've been working with, the reason the first letter (and to a lesser extent, the last letter) is important is that without it the text pattern recognition problem is exponentially more difficult (from a theoretical standpoint anyway) and has to be resolved using deeper abstraction analysis.

I reran the experiment (with the new SpamHam1.pik, but it doesn't seem to make a difference). Here are the clues for the two spams in my inbox (in hammie.py's output format, which sorts the clues by probability; the first two numbers are the message number and overall probability; then line-folded): 66 1.00 S 'facility': 0.01; 'speaker': 0.01; 'stretch': 0.01; 'thursday': 0.01; 'young,': 0.01; 'mistakes': 0.12; 'growth': 0.85; '>content-type:text/plain': 0.85; 'please': 0.85; 'capital': 0.92; 'series': 0.92; 'subject:Don': 0.94; 'companies': 0.96; '>content-type:text/html': 0.96; 'fee': 0.96; 'money': 0.96; '8:00am': 0.99; '9:00am': 0.99; '>content-type:image/gif': 0.99; '>content-type:multipart/alternative': 0.99; 'attend': 0.99; 'companies,': 0.99; 'content-type/type:multipart/alternative': 0.99; 'content-type:multipart/related': 0.99; 'economy': 0.99; 'economy""': 0.99 This has 6 content-types as spam clues, only one of which is related to HTML, despite there being an HTML alternative (and 12 other spam clues, vs. only 6 ham clues). This was an announcement of a public event by our building owners, with a text part that was the same as the HTML (AFAICT). Its language may be spammish, but the content-type clues didn't help. (BTW, it makes me wonder about the wisdom of keeping punctuation -- 'economy' and 'economy""' to me don't seem to deserve two be counted as clues.) 76 1.00 S '(near': 0.01; 'alexandria': 0.01; 'conn': 0.01; 'from:adam': 0.01; 'from:email addr:panix': 0.01; 'poked': 0.01; 'thorugh': 0.01; 'though': 0.03; ""i'm"": 0.03; 'reflect': 0.05; ""i've"": 0.06; 'wednesday': 0.07; 'content-disposition:inline': 0.10; 'contacting': 0.93; 'sold': 0.96; 'financially': 0.98; 'prices': 0.98; 'rates': 0.99; 'discount.': 0.99; 'hotel': 0.99; 'hotels': 0.99; 'hotels.': 0.99; 'nights,': 0.99; 'plaza': 0.99; 'rates,': 0.99; 'rates.': 0.99; 'rooms': 0.99; 'season': 0.99; 'stations': 0.99; 'subject:Hotel': 0.99 Here is the full message (Received: headers stripped), with apologies to Ziggy and David: """""" Date: Fri, 06 Sep 2002 17:17:13 -0400 From: Adam Turoff <ziggy@panix.com> Subject: Hotel information To: guido@python.org, davida@activestate.com Message-id: <20020906211713.GK7451@panix.com> MIME-version: 1.0 Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii Content-disposition: inline User-Agent: Mutt/1.4i I've been looking into hotels. I poked around expedia for availability from March 26 to 29 (4 nights, wednesday thorugh saturday). I've also started contacting hotels for group rates; some of the group rates are no better than the regular rates, and they require signing a contract with a minimum number of rooms sold (with someone financially responsible for unbooked rooms). Most hotels are less than responsive... Radission - Barcelo Hotel (DuPont Circle) $125/night, $99/weekend State Plaza hotel (Foggy Bottom; near GWU) $119/night, $99/weekend Hilton Silver Spring (Near Metro, in suburban MD) $99/hight, $74/weekend Windsor Park Hotel Conn Ave, between DuPont Circle/Woodley Park Metro stations $95/night; needs a car Econo Lodge Alexandria (Near Metro, in suburban VA) $95/night This is a hand picked list; I ignored anything over $125/night, even though there are some really well situated hotels nearby at higher rates. Also, I'm not sure how much these prices reflect an expedia-only discount. I can't vouch for any of these hotels, either. I also found out that the down season for DC Hotels are mid-june through mid-september, and mid-november through mid-january. Z. """""" This one has no MIME structure nor HTML! It even has a Content-disposition which is counted as a non-spam clue. It got f-p'ed because of the many hospitality-related and money-related terms. I'm surprised $125/night and similar aren't clues too.

The first one's a doozie (that's the term, right? :-). It has lots of HTML clues that are apparently ignored. It was a multipart/mixed with two parts: a brief text/plain part containing one or two sentences, a mondo weird URL: http://x60.deja.com/[ST_rn=ps]/getdoc.xp?AN=687715863&CONTEXT=973121507.1408827441&hitnum=23 and some employer-generated spammish boilerplate; the second part was the HTML taken directly from the above URL.

OK, so, you get the XML toss it through hardware and turn it back into a struct/object whatever you call your binary data. I agree this is the way things will go, as XML parsing has just too much overhead to survive in the application layer. So why turn it into XML in the first place?

boingboing <rssfeeds@example.com>,Notes from OSXCon's DRM and Digital Hub panel,"URL: http://boingboing.net/#85516085 Date: Not supplied We did a great panel on DRM and the Digital Hub yesterday here at OSXCon with Tim O'Reilly, Victor Nemachek (from El Gato, makers of the EyeTV digital TV recorder for the Mac), Dan Gillmor, and JD Lasica, who's working on a book on fair use and copyfights. Glenn ""802.11b Networking News"" Fleishman took great notes through the talk: Dan: Tim, you're a ""content or copyright holder�talk about these issues."" Obscurity can be a tool. Something like 100K books published in the US. Most books are forgotten after publication. Ravening copying theft is wrong: most aren't pirated. Publishers puts book that someone sweated over for years on shelves for three months, doesn't sell, that's it, and the author has no rights. Publishers keeps rights til out of print, etc. Oblivion is fate of most books: ""Piracy would be the best thing for those books."" People wouldn't pirate them in general, because people generally like to respect the rights of creators. ""Piracy is a marginal act; it takes away some of the cream."" Publishing won't go away, but it will change the idea of who is a publisher. Early on in the Web, the idea was that everyone could be a publisher. The way in which Web sites interact with publishers is often very much like the way that book publishers try to get placement and position in bookstores. Publishing is aggregation. People will re-emerge as publishers. Will Hollywood be the publishers of the future or will someone else? Users are voting by their use of programs like Kazaa. Eventually, media companies will adopt. But if the changes are hardcoded into law, then we're stuck for a long time with ""some mistakes.""

A. Hettinga"" <rah@shipwright.com> Subject: California needs intelligent energy deregulation Sender: <dbs@philodox.com> http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/4144696.htm?template=contentModules/printstory.jsp Posted on Tue, Sep. 24, 2002 Dan Gillmor: State needs intelligent energy deregulation By Dan Gillmor Mercury News Technology Columnist The facts were trade and government secrets at the time. But the energy industry failed the smell test in 2000 and 2001 as it tried to justify soaring wholesale electricity and natural-gas prices in California. Now, as investigators and regulators unravel the reasons for a financial and fiscal mess we'll be cleaning up for decades, we're learning what everyone suspected. Market games helped engineer the price spikes. The latest manipulation was highlighted in Monday's finding by a federal administrative law judge, who said a dominant natural-gas company squeezed supplies in order to squeeze customers. His ruling came a few days after California's Public Utilities Commission reported that electricity generators mysteriously failed to use available capacity during the crunch, also driving up prices. And don't forget the sleazy games by energy traders who gleefully worked the system, in schemes best summed up by an Enron insider's boast in a memorandum made public in May, that ``Enron gets paid for moving energy to relieve congestion without actually moving any energy or relieving any congestion.'' How much of this was illegal, as opposed to simply amoral, remains to be seen. Unfortunately, California's response -- confusion, lawsuits and policy tweaks -- hasn't been sufficient. More unfortunately, even if the state suddenly did all the right things -- including a hard-nosed program designed to free ourselves from the gougers' grips -- we would need a willing federal partner. But it's foolish to think that the Bush administration would do much to help one of its least favorite states, or do anything that conflicts with its love of traditional, non-renewable energy sources. If the lawsuits against various energy companies and traders bear any fruit, the best we can expect is to pay off some of the massive debts the state amassed to prevent a total collapse in early 2001. That's a reasonable approach, but don't expect miracles. State policies are moving the wrong way on utility regulation, meanwhile. Instead of relentlessly pursuing smart deregulation -- still a good idea if it gives customers genuine choices -- state laws and regulations ``put the utilities back in the business of buying energy for captive customers,'' notes V. John White, executive director of the Sacramento-based Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies (www.ceert.org). It's tempting to call for an outright state takeover of the utilities -- tempting but a bad idea. When there's genuine competition, as we could achieve in electricity generation, the private sector tends to do a better job. Instead of abandoning deregulation, California should find a way to inject real competition into the market. We do need to recognize that the current system of delivering electricity defies privatization, at least under current conditions. Smart regulation is essential. But the best response to gouging is to use less of what the gougers control. There are two ways: conservation and replacement. We need more of both. The best recent step is a new state law that slowly but surely ratchets up the use of electricity from renewables. By 2017, California's utilities will have to get 20 percent of their power from solar and other renewable sources. Several power companies are expected to do this even sooner. But this law has an element of old-line thinking, the captive-customer model we need to be getting away from, not sustaining. Lip service to newer ideas isn't enough. The state should be removing barriers to micro-generation systems, small generators that can run on a variety of fuels and provide decentralized, harder-to-disrupt electricity to homes and businesses. This technology is coming along fast. State policies are not keeping pace. Investing to save energy is increasingly the smartest move of all. California should be doing more to encourage this, whether through tax incentives or outright grants in low-income households. California hasn't done badly on conservation in a general sense, and energy customers did react to last year's soaring rates and blackouts by cutting back, but it's lunacy to wait for the next crisis when we can do something to avoid it altogether. Maybe this is all pointless. The Bush administration's energy policies, so grossly tilted toward the unholy trinity of oil, coal and nuclear, are making us all more vulnerable. Never mind what might happen if the coming war in Iraq goes badly. It's pointless to hope for a sane federal policy -- a crash program to drastically speed the inevitable transition to a hydrogen-based energy system. But the largest state, one of the world's major economies in its own right, does have some clout. We can hit the rip-off artists where it hurts, and protect ourselves from even more serious disruptions. Maybe next year. -- ----------------- R. A.

As I'd written the code a few months ago, we were reading the sequences file first to see what sequences were in it and then once per sequence. This happens anywhere that we look at sequences, most notably in Ftoc_ShowSequences. That seemed to be an obvious lose performancewise, but I wanted my abstraction to have a separate call for ""what sequences are in this folder?"" and ""what messages are in this sequence?"". One option would have been to add another call to get the data off of disk, but I felt that the check-the-modify-time technique would be less error-prone. I think the biggest gains would be from augmenting Ftoc_ShowSequences to allow a finer specification of what needs to be updated in the ftoc so that the current code would only be run when we really do have to update all sequences for all messages. I described these thoughts in an email message yesterday. And again, if it can wait a few weeks, I'm willing to do it.

My recollection about the first message being valid is that the ftoc code wants to find that message to start its highlighting, for example, or you are selecting a message to display. > It may help to keep a list of the valid message numbers for the current > folder (though that would then need to be verified against changes to the > directory). Does tcl have a directory read function? I assume so... glob -nocomplain $mhProfile(path)/$folder * will return an unsorted list of the directory's contents.

In some places I maintain caches of files by checking their modify time, but the sequence files are soo small that by the time you stat them to check their date stamp, you could just read them again. Also, now that we checkpoint message state on every message view, that file will change every time. In the old days exmh used to cache a bunch of state about the folder. -- Brent Welch Software Architect, Panasas Inc Pioneering the World's Most Scalable and Agile Storage Network www.panasas.com welch@panasas.com _______________________________________________ Exmh-workers mailing list Exmh-workers@redhat.com https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-workers",0

Sure thing :) I've added to the spec some flags to remove OSS and ISA-PNP support at build time if one wishes to, so is's possible to do a rpmbuild --recompile <rpm> --without oss --without isapnp (I haven't included OSS in my 2.4.19, because VT82433 on my motherboard is not supported :( yet, and I'm too lazy to recompile the kernel :)). Also, having the kernel compiled by me, I have no kernel-source package installed. I've added a flag ""kernsrc"", that also can be used --without, to remove the dependency for kernel-source at build time. It would be nice to check the correct kernel include files actually exist (/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build/include/linux/*.h), though; however, I'm a beginner in RPM building -- is it possible to BuildRequire for a file not provided by a package at all? I've googled a bit, and found no way to do that. I was also considering adding some sort of flag for the --with-cards option in alsa's ./configure, but don't know how to do that. Only found out about --without from your first alsa-driver.spec, and existing RPM docs don't help much. Oh, and one more thing :). At first I've installed the first version of alsa-driver for 2.4.18-10, although I don't have that kernel, to supply the dependency for the rest of the alsa rpm's, and compiled the modules from source. It created the /dev files and all. Then wanted to make my own rpm for 2.4.19, so now I'm trying to rpmbuild the alsa-kernel package. Removed all alsa rpms, and tried my spec: rpmbuild --ba alsa-driver.spec.mine --without oss --without isapnp --without kernsrc But I get this: ==[long successful compile snipped]===================================== warning: File listed twice: /dev/adsp warning: File listed twice: /dev/amidi Finding Provides: /usr/lib/rpm/find-provides Finding Requires: /usr/lib/rpm/find-requires PreReq: /bin/sh /bin/sh rpmlib(PayloadFilesHavePrefix) <= 4.0-1 rpmlib(CompressedFileNames) <= 3.0.4-1 Requires(interp): /bin/sh /bin/sh Requires(rpmlib): rpmlib(PayloadFilesHavePrefix) <= 4.0-1 rpmlib(CompressedFileNames) <= 3.0.4-1 Requires(post): /bin/sh Requires(postun): /bin/sh Requires: alsa-kernel = 0.9.0rc3 /sbin/depmod Processing files: alsa-kernel-0.9.0rc3-fr4_2.4.19 Finding Provides: /usr/lib/rpm/find-provides Finding Requires: /usr/lib/rpm/find-requires PreReq: rpmlib(PayloadFilesHavePrefix) <= 4.0-1 rpmlib(CompressedFileNames) <= 3.0.4-1 Requires(rpmlib): rpmlib(PayloadFilesHavePrefix) <= 4.0-1 rpmlib(CompressedFileNames) <= 3.0.4-1 Requires: alsa-driver = 0.9.0rc3 kernel = 2.4.19 Checking for unpackaged file(s): /usr/lib/rpm/check-files /var/tmp/alsa-driver-0.9.0rc3-root error: Installed (but unpackaged) file(s) found: /etc/makedev.d/00macros /etc/rc.d/init.d/alsasound RPM build errors: File listed twice: /dev/adsp File listed twice: /dev/amidi Installed (but unpackaged) file(s) found: /etc/makedev.d/00macros /etc/rc.d/init.d/alsasound ======================================================================== Like I said, I'm a beginned with RPM building, so I don't understand much of what's going on here.

Tim Chapman <timc@2ubh.com>,[zzzzteana] Bashing the bishop,"http://www.guardian.co.uk/religion/Story/0,2763,806744,00.html Evangelicals' threat to new archbishop Direct action threat over liberal views on sexuality Stephen Bates, religious affairs correspondent Tuesday October 8, 2002 The Guardian Evangelical fundamentalists last night stepped up their campaign to oust Rowan Williams, the incoming Archbishop of Canterbury, before he even takes up his post, by threatening to take ""direct action"" against him. The council of the Church Society, the Church of England's oldest evangelical body, joined a younger evangelical pressure group called Reform, which is also opposed to Dr Williams, in calling on him to recant his supposedly liberal views on sexuality or stand down. Following an emergency meeting, the 167-year-old society, whose leaders met the archbishop last week, proclaimed their continued opposition to his appointment and called on all Anglicans to spurn him. The move is the latest stage of an increasingly aggressive attempt to destabilise the new archbishop, whose leftwing political views are regarded with deep suspicion by the conservative fringes of the evangelical movement. Some evangelicals object to Dr Williams's acknowledgement that he has ordained a gay priest, something many bishops have done, and that those who have sex outside marriage need not necessarily be spurned. The new archbishop has repeatedly assured them that he respects the canons of the church. Nevertheless, the society said: ""It is clear that he prefers his private judgment to the voice of scripture, to the voice of tradition and to the common mind of the church. As such he can only be a focus of disunity. ""The council... called upon loyal Anglicans to pray specifically that Rowan Williams would see the error in his teaching, change his views or stand down,"" it said. The society claimed to have drawn up an ""action plan,"" including calling on bishops and primates of the 70 million worldwide Anglican communion, of which archbishops of Canterbury are the leaders, to distance themselves from Dr Williams's doctrinal and ethical position. It promised it would be ""taking steps towards appropriate direct action"". It added that Dr Williams remained on the editorial board of a journal called Theology and Sexuality which, six months ago, published articles allegedly commending homosexual behaviour. Despite its claim, the society does not represent the common mind of the church. Dr Williams, currently Archbishop of Wales, was chosen by the crown appointments commission of church members, including evangelicals, and his appointment was endorsed by the prime minister and the Queen. He is due to succeed George Carey, who retires this month, and will be formally enthroned at Canterbury cathedral in February. Asked what form direct action might take, the Rev George Curry, the society's chairman, said: ""Watch this space."" Presumably it could involve a small minority of parishes repudiating the new archbishop and seeking alternative oversight or even demonstrations at services where Dr Williams is present. Church of England bishops, who have hitherto largely kept their heads down during the row, are meeting next week to discuss their response to the evangelical extremists' challenge, which appears to have grown in the absence of a robust rebuttal. A letter by senior theologians in today's Guardian, however, repudiates the evangelicals' tactics, calling them unseemly and contrary to biblical teaching.",0

Politics are somehow more muddy now? I'd say that its considerably clearer - the vast majority of people feel disenfranchised, and the common practice of putting protestors in boxes is done usually to hide them from TV cameras, visiting dignitaries, etc, further exacerbating those feelings. ""Unpeaceably disrupting political rallies"" is now usually done by police with riot gear and pepper spray.

With each passing version, you get more and more bloated, relying on faster machines and more memory to save the day. Who cares if the user interface is now full of 3000 menu items? You still support every last feature since version 1.0, so no customers can possibly be dissatisfied! You can really only cram so many features into a product before its size requirements and performance requirements have to change. This is an obvious rule. It's like you start with an empty elevator that says ""Capacity: 10 people."" The elevator stops at the first floor (version 1.0) and a bunch of people (features) get on. Continuing on its journey, the elevator stops at the second floor, and still more people get on. The elevator is now full, and it continues to the third floor (version 3.0). Unfortunately the elevator is full, but there are a bunch of people waiting at the third floor to get on. Some of them squeeze in anyway, past the fat person from the first floor (the Mozilla sidebar feature) who is taking up enough space for 3 people. Everyone wishes he'd get off at the third floor or even the fourth floor, but he doesn't. Someone (the Mozilla wallet feature) from the second floor cuts one on the way to the third floor, so he's useless, and everyone wishes he'd get off too. He doesn't though. Nobody does. People keep piling in at floor after floor, until eventually the elevator support cable snaps and everybody dies. We need to forcibly eject people from the elevator. Remove the features that nobody wants and replace them with the features that matter. Cull out the features that didn't work in Mozilla 1.0 and make sure they aren't there in Mozilla 2.0. Make more of the features optional plugins so that geeks who want some of the more obscure features (and that have powerhouse machines) can go download them on their own. Only if we actively fight the trend towards bloat will we finally produce an awesome Mozilla browser.",0

There is a lot of C++ in the embedded world. With static object allocation and a few other programming techniques, performance differences disappear, but C++ gives a boost in development and maintainability. The real issue is compiler availability. Almost every embedded platform has C cross-compilers. Many have C++ compilers. But there is still a range of platforms that have the first but not the second.

You're really better off backuping all placed where you know you've hand edited or installed some files. For me that's only /etc/, /root/ and /home/. Then you reinstall cleanly, formating ""/"", put your /home/ files back into place and you're ready to go. That's the moment I usually realize I had a nifty tweak to a file in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ or some special parameters added to an /etc/modules.conf entry... so I look at my backup and make the same change again. The only thing where you can get stuck is the grub.conf files, because although there's a /etc/grub.conf link, it's actually in /boot/grub/ so you may want to copy it too if you have special kernel parameters to save (I have to pass ""pci=bios,biosirq"" for one of my computers to work for example).

This week, Dan takes Valenti's arguments apart, looking at what Hollywood's agenda really entails: So the movie and music companies are going back to Congress for another helping. They are asking for laws that would force technology innovators to restrict the capabilities of devices -- cripple PCs and other machines that communicate so they can't make copies the copyright holders don't explicitly allow. Amazingly, the entertainment industry also wants permission to hack into networks and machines they believe are being used to violate copyrights. Here is what it all means. To protect a business model and thwart even the possibility of infringement, the cartel wants technology companies to ask permission before they can innovate. The media giants want to keep information flow centralized, to control the new medium as if it's nothing but a jazzed-up television. Instead of accepting, as they do today, that a certain amount of penny-ante infringement will occur and then going after the major-league pirates, they call every act of infringement -- and some things that aren't infringement at all -- an act of piracy or stealing. Saying it doesn't make it so.

MTA level filtering would just need to use a different corpus, one that would contain illegal or otherwise commonly unapproved material for the group of people using that MTA. I'm sure that such an approach would significantly reduce the mail traffic as a first step, without giving false positives.

I've looked for web-stuff to answer this question but I can't find anything specific on this scenario. Here's the situation. I have a global /etc/procmailrc file. It works, and when I insert stuff into it for logging (LOGFILE=/root/procmail.log, VERBOSE=yeah. LOGABSTRACT=all) it shows up where I expect it to (the log in /root/procmail.log) At the end of this file, I use :0fw | spamc to call spamassassin. Also in it is a carboncopy recipe (yes, I know, it's one of the evils we do for our corporate masters) (at the top) (to their credit, I am instructed that they are not interested in the actual contents, but are concerned about future lawsuits and their culpability, so they want a record made.

The result, to put it succinctly, is ""nothing"". No forwards go out, no files are made, if I try to log information, no logs are set up. I've modified the user/group and permissions to match known-working recipes (the spermfun example above) and still nothing. However, I can redirect those other messages.

Bill Stoddard <bill@wstoddard.com>,Hanson's Sept 11 message in the National Review,"http://www.nationalreview.com/hanson/hanson091102.asp September 11, 2002 8:00 a.m. The Wages of September 11 There is no going back. September 11 changed our world. Those who deny such a watershed event take a superficially short-term view, and seem to think all is as before simply because the sun still rises and sets. This is a colossal misjudgment. The collapse of the towers, the crashing into the Pentagon, and the murder of 3,000 Americans  all seen live in real time by millions the world over  tore off a scab and exposed deep wounds, which, if and when they heal, will leave ugly scars for decades. The killers dealt in icons  the choice of 911 as the date of death, targeting the manifest symbols of global capitalism and American military power, and centering their destruction on the largest Jewish city in the world. Yes, they got their symbols in spades, but they have no idea that their killing has instead become emblematic of changes that they could scarcely imagine. Islamic fundamentalism has proved not ascendant, but static, morally repugnant  and the worst plague upon the Arab world since the Crusades. By lurking in the shadows and killing incrementally through stealth, the vampirish terrorists garnered bribes and subsidies through threats and bombs; but pale and wrinkled in the daylight after 9/11, they prove only ghoulish not fearsome. The more the world knows of al Qaeda and bin Laden, the more it has found them both vile and yet banal  and so is confident and eager to eradicate them and all they stand for. It is one thing to kill innocents, quite another to take on the armed might of an aroused United States. Easily dodging a solo cruise missile in the vastness of Afghanistan may make good theater and bring about braggadocio; dealing with grim American and British commandos who have come 7,000 miles for your head prompts abject flight and an occasional cheap infomercial on the run. And the ultimate consequence of the attacks of September 11 will not merely be the destruction of al Qaeda, but also the complete repudiation of the Taliban, the Iranian mullocracy, the plague of the Pakistani madrassas, and any other would-be fundamentalist paradise on earth. Foreign relations will not be the same in our generation. Our coalition with Europe, we learn, was not a partnership, but more mere alphabetic nomenclature and the mutual back scratching of Euro-American globetrotters  a paper alliance without a mission nearly 15 years after the end of the Cold War. The truth is that Europe, out of noble purposes, for a decade has insidiously eroded its collective national sovereignty in order to craft an antidemocratic EU, a 80,000-person fuzzy bureaucracy whose executive power is as militarily weak as it is morally ambiguous in its reliance on often dubious international accords. This sad realization September 11 brutally exposed, and we all should cry for the beloved continent that has for the moment completely lost its moral bearings. Indeed, as the months progressed the problems inherent in ""the European way"" became all too apparent: pretentious utopian manifestos in lieu of military resoluteness, abstract moralizing to excuse dereliction of concrete ethical responsibility, and constant American ankle-biting even as Europe lives in a make-believe Shire while we keep back the forces of Mordor from its picturesque borders, with only a few brave Frodos and Bilbos tagging along. Nothing has proved more sobering to Americans than the skepticism of these blinkered European hobbits after September 11. America learned that ""moderate"" Arab countries are as dangerous as hostile Islamic nations. After September 11, being a Saudi, Egyptian, or Kuwaiti means nothing special to an American  at least not proof of being any more friendly or hostile than having Libyan, Syrian, or Lebanese citizenship. Indeed, our entire postwar policy of propping up autocracies on the triad of their anticommunism, oil, and arms purchases  like NATO  belongs to a pre-9/11 age of Soviet aggrandizement and petroleum monopolies. Now we learn that broadcasting state-sponsored hatred of Israel and the United States is just as deadly to our interests as scud missiles  and as likely to come from friends as enemies. Worst-case scenarios like Iran and Afghanistan offer more long-term hope than ""stable regimes"" like the Saudis; governments that hate us have populations that like us  and vice versa; the Saudi royal family, whom 5,000 American troops protect, and the Mubarak autocracy, which has snagged billions of American dollars, are as afraid of democratic reformers as they are Islamic fundamentalists. And with good reason: Islamic governments in Iran and under the Taliban were as hated by the masses as Arab secular reformers in exile in the West are praised and championed. The post-9/11 domestic calculus is just as confusing. Generals and the military brass call civilians who seek the liberation of Iraq ""chicken hawks"" and worse. Yet such traditional Vietnam-era invective I think rings hollow after September 11, and sounds more like McClellan's shrillness against his civilian overseers who precipitously wanted an odious slavery ended than resonant of Patton's audacity in charging after murderous Nazis. More Americans were destroyed at work in a single day than all those soldiers killed in enemy action since the evacuation of Vietnam nearly 30 years ago. Indeed, most troops who went through the ghastly inferno of Vietnam are now in or nearing retirement; and, thank God, there is no generation of Americans in the present military  other than a few thousand brave veterans of the Gulf, Mogadishu, and Panama  who have been in sustained and deadly shooting with heavy casualties. Because American soldiers and their equipment are as impressive as our own domestic security is lax, in this gruesome war it may well be more perilous to work high up in lower Manhattan, fly regularly on a jumbo jet, or handle mail at the Pentagon or CIA than be at sea on a sub or destroyer. Real concern for the sanctity of life may hinge on employing rather than rejecting force, inasmuch as our troops are as deadly and protected abroad as our women, children, aged, and civilians are impotent and vulnerable at home. It seems to me a more moral gamble to send hundreds of pilots into harm's way than allow a madman to further his plots to blow up or infect thousands in high-rises. Politics have been turned upside down. In the old days, cynical conservatives were forced to hold their noses and to practice a sometimes repellent Realpolitik. In the age of Russian expansionism, they were loathe to champion democracy when it might usher in a socialist Trojan Horse whose belly harbored totalitarians disguised as parliamentarians. Thus they were so often at loggerheads with naïve and idealist leftists. No longer. The end of the specter of a deadly and aggressive Soviet Communism has revived democratic ideology as a force in diplomacy. Champions of freedom no longer sigh and back opportunistic rightist thugs who promise open economics, loot their treasuries, and keep out the Russians. Instead, even reactionaries are now more likely to push for democratic governments in the Middle East than are dour and skeptical leftists. The latter, if multiculturalists, often believe that democracy is a value-neutral Western construct, not necessarily a universal good; if pacifists, they claim nonintervention, not justice, as their first priority. The Right, not the Left, now is the greater proponent of global freedom, liberation, and idealism  with obvious domestic ramifications for any Republican president astute enough to tap that rich vein of popular support. All this and more are the wages of the disaster of September 11 and the subsequent terrible year  and yet it is likely that, for good or evil, we will see things even more incredible in the twelve months ahead.",0

Adam Shostack <adam@homeport.org>,Re: the underground software vulnerability marketplace and its hazards (fwd),"Hi Kragen, This is an interesting analysis. I think that there are a couple of nits I might pick (for example, I don't expect that the market will be well developed with highest bidders for while), I think that the most important issue, which is that end users won't be able to fix their systems, is almost passed over. I know that you know this, and you allude to it, but your essay is getting passed around, so you might want to add to it bits about the sysadmin and others. There's one other point which you don't make, which I think is very important, which is that research into defining and addressing classes of vulnerabilities can't happen without libraries of available vulnerability code. I can think of three researchers into automated methods for addressing vulnerabilities who griped, uninvited, about the quality of the existing vulnerability sites. Doing research into a set requires that you have enough examples, in the open, that you can define a set, and that the set is added to from time to time so you can make and test predictions. I feel fairly confident in saying that without full disclosure, we wouldn't have Stackguard, ITS4, Nissus, or snort. And the security admin's job would be a lot harder. Adam",0

Joe Berry <joe@topshot.com>,[Razor-users] Reducing impact from tons of email,"I'm not sure if this is really a razor problem/issue or a sendmail problem. Here's the scenario... My mail server is a 150mhz PC funning FreeBSD 4.4. Ordinarily, the machine is quite idle; it supports my wife's web site with Apache server running on it and a few other services (jabber, etc). Between the various members of our family, we get a fair amount of email coming in (mailing lists, etc). On occasion, our DSL-based ISP dies for a number of hours. When we get a reconnection to the Internet, I get a huge flow of emails coming in which are then filtered via razor. As a result, I will sometimes see over 20+ sendmail processes running at the same time after such an occasion. The machine is then REALLY slow. I noticed that my /etc/procmailrc file had had no arguments associated with the call to razor-check. There was something in the log, though, to make me suspicious that it was possibly not seeing all my razor files. So I have just added ""-home /etc/razor"" as an argument. I haven't had any down time since then so I cannot comment on whether this change has sped up my razor processing a noticable amount. (This paragraph may be an aside to my real problem, the first paragraph above; but I thought I should be complete in my description.) At any rate, has anyone else suffered from a backlog of email processing creating lots and lots of sendmail processes? Is there, perhaps, a way to limit the number of sendmail processes?

Andy <andy@r2-dvd.org>,[zzzzteana] US Army tests portable translator,"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/2219079.stm US soldiers on peacekeeping duties in the future could find that a portable translation device will be an essential part of their equipment. Scientists at Carnegie Mellon University have developed a prototype of a speech translator that was road-tested by US Army chaplains in Croatia. ""This project shows how a relatively simple speech-to-speech translation system can be rapidly and successfully constructed using today's tools,"" said the team from Carnegie Mellon University in a research paper published recently. The research was commissioned by the US Army, which is increasingly finding itself in peace-keeping roles where communication is key. Speaking in tongues ""In the Balkans, the Army is not just supposed to conquer somebody,"" Robert Frederking of Carnegie Mellon University told the BBC programme Go Digital. Translators could be essential for US soldiers ""In a peacekeeping situation, you have two guys trying to beat each other up and you are holding them apart. ""You can't just shot one of them, you have to figure what is going on and talk to them,"" he said. The portable translator was developed with a year, using commercially available laptops. The Army did not want to field-test the device in a battlefield situation. So instead the translator was tested by US Army chaplains in Croatia. ""The chaplains very often end up having to talk to foreign nationals and typically don't have any translation support,"" explained Mr Frederking. Slow system For the trials, the chaplains used the translator to speak to Croatians who knew just a smattering of English. The system works by having a speech recogniser that picks up the words in Croatian, turns the speech into text. The written words are then translated into English and read out by a speech synthesizer. ""It went reasonably well half the time,"" said Mr Frederking, though it was slow in translating phrases. The research team admit that the system is not ready to be deployed in the field. But they say their trials showed that a portable translator could be made to work with further research and development. The Audio Voice Translation Guide System project was a joint venture between the US Army, the military manufacturer Lockheed Martin and Carnegie Mellon University. ------------------------ Yahoo!

I think the only thing that stops us now are acts of dieties and total economic collapse..so no one mention the dow for the next few weeks.. In preperation we drove to Best Buy tonight and picked up the test core for the wifi net. I got a linksys BEFW11S4(1) for the router/hub/wireless ap/firewall/etc and a linksys wifi pcmcia card for the laptop I made one false move so it took about 30 mins all told to set up the card, the router, and the other 3 machines in the house on the wire ether hub. All vfery neat very easy and very very cool set up via the webinterface. I have to dig into the firewall/nat/routing features some more (i have been reading up the wifi security blackpaper on ars technica) but all in all a smooth move. Now the place im at now, the house soon to be the ex house, has lots of funky things going on in the walls and in the area. We are in , essentialy, a gravel pit..recption of all types suck and transmisions get goofy inside the pit.

ThosStew@aol.com,Re: Re[3]: Selling Wedded Bliss (was Re: Ouch...),"Here are numbers that come from a study of a couple of thousand swedes, with no reference to sexual preference that I could find. The point would seem to be that (1) sexual activity follows a power curve, with a few people, a la Wilt Chamberlain, having an extaordinarily large number of sexual contacts, ev en in a short period of time and (2) a tendency for men to have more partners than women. I have no idea, being a statistical ignoramus, whether the fact that there seem to be more men than women at the extremely promiscuous end of the sex-partners-distribution curve means that you'd get even more extreme results in a group of men who chiefly have sex with other men. http://polymer.bu.edu/~amaral/Sex_partners/Content_sex.html <<For example, the mean number of partners since sexual initiation for women is approximately 7 and in a sample of less than 1500 Swedish women we find an individual with 100 partners. For men, the mean is approximately 15 and we find an individual with 800 partners, which is almost 50 times larger than the mean! So, somehow Don Juan was not such an extraordinary case but just one data point in a wide spectrum of behaviors that can be observed. >> As for gay men: There is indeed anecdotal evidence of cases of extreme promiscuity among gay men. You can read about it in Randy Schiltz's And the Band Played On. He writes about bathhouse culture pre-HIV; he also discusses how, in the gay politics of the time, there was a sub-culture of what you might call radical gay men who argued (and acted on the argument) that having many partners was an essential part of what being gay actually was. It was an explicitly political statement: monogamy is an artifact of straight culture. That view seems to have died, in more ways than one. Part of the point of Schiltz's book was to condemn the role that it and bathhouse culture played in spreading the AIDs epidemic that eventually killed Schiltz, among so many others. This doesn't let Eugen off the hook--but it is accurate to say that there was a cult of promiscuity that was particular to the gay community. Tom",0

John Hall <johnhall@evergo.net>,RE: Goodbye Global Warming,"For anyone to fully bury global warming, they would have to bury the Greens. A Green once said that if the Spotted Owl hadn't existed they would have had to invent it. So it is with global warming. Their fundamental opposition isn't to a warmer earth, it is to industrial civilization. The fact that the sattelites didn't match what the global warming theorists said should be there is old news. The news here is that the temperature measures via sattelite have gotten even better and they have been validated with a different means of measurement. Rather than have to defend CO2 concentrations as not causing global warming, people who believe in CO2 need a good explanation of the ""Medieval Warm Period"". Said period was warmer than what we have now, and it obvioiusly wasn't caused by CO2. In point of fact the predicted global warming due to CO2 is not caused DIRECTLY by CO2. CO2 doesn't trap that much heat. Water vapor does, and if you can get more water vapor in the air due to CO2 then you have your warming theory. Yet it would seem that the very stability of the earth's climate over long periods argues not for an unstable system with positive feedback loops but one where negative feedback loops predominate. More water vapor can increase temperatuers, but that also leads to more clouds. Clouds both trap heat and reflect it, so it depends a great deal on how the cloud formation shakes out. Most climate models admit they do clouds very poorly.

Liam Bedford <pro@linux.ie>,[ILUG] Marketing SIG has a good start :),"|::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::| IT's Monday 520 02 September 2002 |::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::| STUDENT LIFE BEGINS WITH LINUX by John Sterne The launch last month of a marketing special interest group by the Irish Linux Users Group (ILUG) - open source and marketing, it seems, might not be mutually exclusive concepts - has already sparked an interesting initiative at University College Cork. When the new academic year begins at UCC, every incoming student will be offered a copy of Red Hat Linux 7.3. ILUG member Braun Brelin proposed this promotion, when he ran a training class for staff at the UCC computer science department. Brelin, who is the director of technology at OpenApp, says that the Linux offer could be extended to any or all of the other Irish universities. The user group is tapping into an international Red Hat programme that aims to introduce students at all levels to the open source style of computing. The Linux distributor runs an 'educational channel' to reach this audience, bundling educational software with its operating environment and offering networked support services to eligible applicants. This scheme was originally designed to suit the educational structures in the US, but is now available to schools and universities throughout the world. Red Hat Linux 7.3 incorporates ease of use and maintenance features and is intended to counter objections that Linux is hard to master on personal systems. The Linux-for-all project at UCC could also raise the profile of Red Hat Ireland. Based in Cork, this operation has run shared financial services for other Red Hat offices in Europe since 2000. Until now its involvement with users in Ireland has been fairly limited, although it does sometimes refer them to other Red Hat offices in Europe that offer consulting or technical support services. David Owens, Red Hat's director of global logistics and production, sees the formation of the ILUG marketing group as a reason to take a more proactive approach. In the last three months, he notes, his office in Cork has received more and more calls from Irish companies that are interested in adopting Linux and has introduced some to Red Hat pre-sales consultants. ------------- Many thanks are due to Braun and David for working together on this one.

What it boils down to is that only the privileged class is really allowed to start a serious company. What I found fascinating is that the old French aristocracy effectively still exists (literally the same families), but they now hold top executive and management positions in the major French firms and the government, positions which are only passed on to other blue bloods. Not officially of course, but as a strict matter of practice. And the laws and legal structures make sure that this system stays firmly in place. Even for a young French blue blood, strict age hierarchies keep them from branching out into a new venture in their own country (though many can leverage this to start companies in OTHER countries). I know about the French system first-hand and the executives are quite candid about it (at least to Yanks like me who are working with them), but I suspect this may hold true for other European countries as well. After all those ""revolutions"", France is still nothing more than a thinly veiled old-school aristocracy, with all the trappings. -James Rogers jamesr@best.com",0

If you hate that, go to the | Bindings... Simple Edit preferences window and de-select | ""Paste Sets Insert"". Unfortunately, the side effect of that solution is that it is no longer possible to cut/paste within one sedit window, some intermediate client always must be used (except in the rare case where you want to select some text, and then paste it at the same place). That's because the click that you have to (with this option) make to set the insert point, also kills the selection (it ends up reverting to the last selection made in some other window, or something like that). So, the vast majority of people probably want that ""Paste Sets Insert"" enabled - that one you can learn to live with, the other is much more painful. kre _______________________________________________ Exmh-users mailing list Exmh-users@redhat.com https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-users",0

Not very muddied at all. What does that exactly have to do with the statement that distruption of peacable political assembly has become a common practice disruption tool? It's an observation not a judgement, comment, approval. You've focused on the word ""muddy"" to use it in a different context than the one I posted.

The only little (unimportant) catch is to replace ""kernel-headers"" by ""glibc-kernheaders"", a simple ""apt-get install glibc-kernheaders"" taking care of that. Upgrading between releases is meant to work, not between betas or beta and releases. The reason is simple : Some packages may have been downgraded, some others may have been rebuilt with the same versions but different dependencies. For both these categories of packages, the upgrade through apt/rhn/whatever just won't do, as some older packages might be considered as the newest, thus being kept on the system. As Red Hat does, I really don't recommend trying to upgrade between betas or from a beta to a final release either. Simply backup your /home, /etc (and /root and/or /usr/local/ if needed) then reinstall cleanly, it'll probably save a few hassles and you'll get the cleanest possible system ;-) Matthias -- Matthias Saou World Trade Center ------------- Edificio Norte 4 Planta System and Network Engineer 08039 Barcelona, Spain Electronic Group Interactive Phone : +34 936 00 23 23 _______________________________________________ RPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net> http://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list",0

He did confirm that problems had spread beyond the east coast and are now seen nationwide through out their network. They are currently working with their hardware vendor to try and isolate the issue. A large number of Internap's connections to UUnet remain shutdown and traffic is being routed over alternate providers. The scale of this outage is causing a large number of peering points with UUnet and other providers to be flooded due to the large traffic shifts. If you have problems reaching specific sites please send an email to noc@internap.com containing a traceroute and source/destination IP addresses and we will investigate. If it is possible will will attempt to move specific prefixes onto an alternate provider leaving an Internap PNAP if that will provide better performance.

No that is appropriate content for the file. I'm not a C programmer, but I think that these sort of things (#include <blahblah>) are instructions to the compiler processed by a pre-processor in the compile process, and include all sorts of symbols/functions e.g. ""#include <math.h>"" gives you maths type functions. Since they start with ""#"" they are ignored in the final compilation. Regarding the rest of the compile process, you need to tell the PCtel software to look in the right place for the kernel headers/source. I recall from your previous mail that there was a flag --with-kernel-includes=/usr/src/linux-2.4 which could be passed to the ./configure script (with the appropriate directory in place of /usr/src/linux-2.4). This might allow you to persuade the code to compile against the correct headers. I think this is the right way to proceed. Alternatively, maybe the steps above regarding ""make dep"" and so forth should have been performed in the directory where the make process is looking for modversions.h & Co. I don't think it is a good idea keep moving files into the directory as you describe below. First of all you will move modversions.h (which you have done), then you would have to move all those *.ver files, after that, there will almost certainly be a need for further header (*.h) files. This could be quickly done, but is probably bad (those files don't really belong there). For what it's worth I think you are very close to a successful compilation. m > > Also, when I was in the pctel directory and typed ""make"", I noticed > that a different subdirectory is taken to a different modversions.h > file.

I've sketched out an approach a listserver like Mailman could do along these lines and if I get some free time I'll hack something together.

The savannah monitor lizard was captured at Chapel St Leonards, Lincs, on Sunday by a member of the public before being collected by an RSPCA team. RSPCA officer Justin Stubbs, who took the lizard to a specialist carer, said: ""Savannah monitors can give a nasty bite and we certainly wouldn't have wanted one loose in a busy holiday resort for long."" Officials believe the animal may have been abandoned by a private owner because it has not been reported missing. Savannah monitor lizards originate in Africa and are carnivorous, eating rats and small rodents. They can grow to 4ft in length. Anyone with information about the lizard can contact the RSPCA in confidence on 08705 555 999. ------------------------ Yahoo!

OK, noone has been tool-less for memory management for a LONG time. Most systems you just add a flag and memory is tracked (that's how i've always done it) or worst case yuo have to run it through one of the 2.3E7 tools where you simply recompile and it it tells you where the leaks are.

diveintomark <rssfeeds@example.com>,When an engineer flaps his wings,"URL: http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/10/03.html#when_an_engineer_flaps_his_wings Date: 2002-10-03T01:31:51-05:00 Remember that saying from chaos theory about how when a butterfly flap its wings, it can cause a hurricane a month later halfway around the world? As several people have already noted, Google has made some major changes in their most recent update. The weblogging community was hit hard (for instance, I used to be the #1 ""mark""[1]; I am now #6). The changes appear to be the result of an attempt to stop two phenomena: explicitly selling ads based on PageRank[2], and Google bombing[3]. Specifically, Google is now apparently cross-checking link text with the linked site, and discounting or ignoring links whose text does not appear in the linked site. This all but kills off Google bombing. Searching for ""go to hell"" [4] no longer takes you to microsoft.com[5]; searching for ""talentless hack""[6] no longer finds ohmessylife.com[7], although it finds a lot of people who were previously participating in the Google bombing. No definitive word yet on whether Google is actively penalizing such sites. Unfortunately, the algorithm tweaks necessary to stop these two techniques have caused a wide range of collateral damage, apparently coming down hardest on medium-to-large sites that had previously been doing everything right (as far as page structure, link structure, accessibility, and general honest hard work putting together a usable and useful site). The Webmasterworld forums are alive with complaints and speculation: - New update, pagerank death?[8] - September 2002 Google Update Discussion - part 1[9] - Let's find out what happened - Sept 2002 Update - pt. 2[10] (Side note: amongst the confusion, it has been suggested that Google is no longer indexing ALT text in images. I can confirm that this is absolutely false. Searching diveintomark.org for ""gimli""[11] finds my entry of July 29[12] , where ""Gimli"" is mentioned only in the ALT text of an image.) Regardless, Google's search results in general appear to be significantly degraded in many key areas. The forums are full of people complaining that spam sites, doorway pages, and obvious cloaking attempts, which Google used to be so good at filtering out, are now popping up in top spots with disturbing frequency. Nobody in the forums wants to talk about which keywords they're tracking, so I tried to find my own concrete example of crap search results. It didn't take long. - Searching for reservation hotel[13] brings up an empty sub-page[14] of a hotel reservation company in Italy[15] as the first result. This seems unhelpful, and unlikely to be relevant to the average US-based consumer (and Google absolutely knows I'm in the US based on my IP address). - Searching for news observer nc[16] (the News & Observer is a Raleigh, NC newspaper) does find The News & Observer[17], but it also finds an Internet betting spam page[18] at #7 and a non-existent page[19] at #9. - Searching for eminem[20] gives us two generic portal pages, a non-existent site, and a site that redirects to a site that continuously redirects to itself (I am not making this up). And this is just on the first page. Good thing I didn't care that much about Eminem to begin with, because Google just isn't that helpful. Many people in the Webmasterworld forums are now suggesting that AllTheWeb.com [21] has better search results overall. Just as a single comparison, their results for ""eminem""[22] do appear to be much more relevant. Is this the beginning of the end of Google's reign?

"""John P. Looney"" <valen@tuatha.org>",Re: [ILUG] Sun Solaris..,"On Thu, Aug 22, 2002 at 05:13:01PM +0100, Fergal Moran mentioned: > In a nutshell - Solaris is Suns own flavour of UNIX. Though I'm sure that this nice person would like a bit more detail. Solaris is quite different to Linux, though these days you can make solaris act a lot like linux with an extra CD of GNU tools Sun ship with solaris. It is based on the SysV unix family, so it's quite similar to other unixen like HPUX and SCO. Sun's hardware in general is more reliable, and a lot more expensive. One of the main bonuses you get by buying Sun is that you are getting your hardware and software from one company, so if you have a support contract, they have to fix it. They can't fob you off with 'that's a software problem, talk to the software vendor.' etc. If you are set on Linux, you most likely can do your own support. There is then a world of different hardware options. You can run Linux on Sparc, though some companies like RedHat don't maintain a sparc port anymore. You can also buy your machine from linux-oriented companies like DNUK, who do machines designed to run linux, and their own version of linux, that has a few extras for their machines. Or, you can get a machine from a cheaper company like Dell, and it'll most likely work, most of the time.

Tom <tomwhore@slack.net>,Since we were on the subject...,"Gays, gay sex, gay marriage.....wooohooo its been a mano e mano week and thursady will be the mass market consumer period on it. The WWE's gay marriage cermemony is in the can, that is its been filmed last night for thursady nights Smackdown. Did they do it tastefully? Oh come on its the WWE for cripssake, of course they didnt. Did they use it ot promote an story line? Despite the WWE throwing away more good story lines in the last 2 years than a wood chuck who could chuck wood if the enviromentalists did not slap lawsuits on them, the sotrywrites seemed to have finaly hit on a big tie togther event for several story lines. But of course, no one here watches the WWE, and not even because you would rather watch old Divxs of the ECW, so this little bit is probably fallign on the old killsawfiles. SO I wont be bursting anyones thursdaynight plans if I smarkout and say that B and C waver near the final vows, the blame is falling on Ricco, thier ""manager""*, for pushing them to carry out their ""gay"" act far too long and just when things look to be heating up with that story arc......the mask comes off the justice of the piece as he pronounces that they have gone 3 minutes, yes 3 minutes, too long.....Yep, its the Bisch and in come Rosey and Jamal to attempt a stomping on Stpehnie McMahon. Hopefully they did not get off a kick like they did on the first lesbain back on Mondays raw as that broke a rib. Of course the editing truck boys might change some none or all of this around, so if thursday nights tape play reveals them hitch and on thier way to a honeymoon, thats the luck o the smarkies. I doubt it will be edited much though from the way I heard it. So the bottomline is, they really were not gay all along, they were play acting and it got out of hand because Ricco made them, Steaphnie gets a face push while the Bisch gets a thursady night special 3 min heel push, thus furthing the story arc of the brand split. Rosey and Jamala get heat and B and C get a new Tag Team to play with. Ricco..who knows, maybe some heat time would be good for him as a single. All this of course at a time when the ratting are in the bottom of a 4 year valley of gloom, the last 2 years have been mostly squandered on borken story arc promises and bad acting, and to top it all off Mick is no longer ont he sceen so...bang bang...how can it be all good? Well, its back to my growing ECW divx collection where Tajiri was the shiz and Mick cut promos unrivaled by any of todays mic monkeys. * Todays managers are a far cry form the managers of the 80's/early 90's.

This seems bogus to me. A quick check of the text indicates the the Hebrew word in question is GANAV which elsewhere in the Pentateuch (eg Gen 44.8) is used to mean steal silver and gold amongst other things. In July 1999, I made the following comment in response to a similar claim about the ""real"" meaning of one of the ten commandments: """""" > The translations since cause problems at each successive remove We have the original language versions, though, so this is not an issue. > I'm sure most everyone is familiar with the argument that the meaning of the commandment > is 'thou shalt not murder' rather than 'kill,' This has nothing to do with successive translations.

Gregory Alan Bolcer <gbolcer@endeavors.com>,UCI Creative Writing,"More articles that support my fantasy that Irvine is the center of the universe. We've got the corner on electric cars, fuel cells, two types of Nobel winning physics, outside the box computer science, and lot of creative writers. UCI's creative writing department has been in the news a lot over the course of the last decade. Some quotes from the article[1]: ""In 1992, Newsweek called UCI's fiction writing workshop 'the hottest writing program in the country.' Now it's exponentially hotter, thanks only in part to Sebold's daring and uncannily timely novel. The novel they are talking about is Alice Sebold's ""The Lovely Bones"" which is on the way to the top of the NY Times best-sellers list. My uncle used to tease me about UCI (being a USC graduate from '54) that nobody knew who UC Irvine was just two states over. In fact, I used to refer to UCI as one of the lesser known UC schools, and when I went off to college in 1985, my relatives told everyone I was off to Cal State Irvine. I took a class as an undergrad by one of the department's faculty called ""the art of writing fiction"". If there was ever any two classes that helped contributed to writing my dissertation, it was that one which taught me how to get the writing flowing and my high school typing class which taught me how to type really fast. One of the advantages they cite in the article is that they seem to take a chance on the ""not-so-sure"" bet, but according to the article, the number of UCI graduates that have gone on to write best sellers and the handful that feed the film industry is creating a viscious cycle that lures more talent which creates the right writing ecosystem, which churns out more success stories which lures more talent.

Gregory Alan Bolcer <gbolcer@endeavors.com>,Sun,"Well, it looks like Sun are going ahead with their ubiquitous computing plans without Mithril. Greg Reuters Market News Sun Micro Outlines Roadmap for Managing Networks Friday September 20, 5:00 am ET By Peter Henderson SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Computer maker Sun Microsystems Inc. on Thursday said it would create in a few years a network environment that will be as straightforward to handle as a single machine, a strategy it calls N1. It laid out a road map for a new layer of intelligent software and systems that will meld unwieldy networks into easy-to-use systems, a goal similar to those of most rivals making computers which manage networks. EMC Corp. announced this week software aimed at allowing users to manage storage resources as a pool. Hewlett-Packard Co has a Utility Data Center, designed for broader management. International Business Machines Corp's project eLiza is working to make computers ""self-healing"" when systems break. ""Applications still have to run zeroes and ones on some computing engine but the whole idea behind N1 is you stop thinking about that. You don't think about what box it is running on,"" Sun Vice President Steve MacKay, head of the N1 program, said in an interview on the sidelines of a Sun user conference. Many industry executives see computer power eventually being sold like power or water, as a utility that can be turned on or off, in whatever volume one wants whenever needed. For that to happen computers must be tied together seamlessly, rather than cobbling them together with tenuous links, as most networks do today, experts say. There are still major barriers, though, such as communications standards for machines from different vendors to interoperate closely. Sun promised to deliver a ""virtualization engine"" that would let administrators look at their entire network as a pool by the end of the year. Network administrators today often have no automatic system to report what is in the network. ""It'll tell you what you have and how it is laid out,"" promised MacKay The second stage, beginning in 2003, would allow users to identify a service, such as online banking, and allocate resources for them with a few clicks, Sun said. Finally, in 2004, Sun's software should allow networks to change uses of resources on the fly in response to changing needs, such as a bank assuring quicker online response time for priority users, the company said.",0
Siva Doriaswamy <siva@SandCraft.com>,Changed location of incoming mail. exmh not working!!,"I use exmh 2.5 with procmail for presorting incoming mail and move it to the relevant folder using rcvstore. Recently, my incoming mail (or spool) location moved to another disk. I'm not quite clear how to reconfigure procmail/rcvstore/exmh to accept mail from the new location. There seems to be a variable in exmh-defaults (bgspool). It says at the top of the file not to edit these lines. So, I went ahead and edited it :-) That does not make a difference. It seems like procmail is the one that is actually reading the mail from my spool/incoming mail area and piping it to rcvstore. So, I need to configure that probably. Any idea how I would do this?

We even flew Mullah Omar to Texas to try and convince him. After it was clear that wouldn't work, we threatened to bomb them and begun attacking on a smaller scale for a year before 9-11. We already planned to invade two months before the attacks. While it's not clear they knew about 9-11 it certainly provided a convenient cover for their plans. Three days after we started bombing, we begun official work on the pipeline Karzai, the Afghanistan president we installed (who incidentally used to work for the oil company Unocal and was a former Talib) focused on the pipeline rather than rebuilding his torn country. Yet, the entire pipeline is unworkable because it's too expensive and will be sabotaged by warlords and Pakistan. Bin Laden was essentially a venture capitalist: he funded attacks but didn't carry them out. It's far more likely that an Egyptian group, Islamic Jihad, carried out the attacks. If we wanted to stop the terrorists, we should have gone after them. If we wanted to stop anti-Americanism, we should have gone after Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Instead, our bombing created the perfect opportunity for Bin Laden to escape. Nor did we bother to stabilize Afghanistan, the country is as ruined as ever. ""Unfortunately, our government seized the moment as well, not to do good or right, but to take advantage--of our grief, of our naivete, of our lust for justice and vengeance. They did it to line the pockets of themselves and their friends, to gain political and economic advantage for a tiny coterie of influential people. In doing so, they endangered the rest of us. They took advantage of our ignorance about Islam, Caspian Sea oil and remote Central Asia. I have faith that the fundamental goodness of the American people will cause them to see what was done in their name, and to do something about it.""

It really had to do with something other than MIME/HTML. 2. These are pure HTML (not multipart/alternative with a text/plain part), so that the tags aren't getting stripped. The pickled classifier despises all hints of HTML due to its c.l.py heritage. 3. These are multipart/alternative with a text/plain part, but the latter doesn't contain the same text as the text/html part (for example, as Anthony reported, perhaps the text/plain part just says something like ""This is an HMTL message."").

While I appreciate the flexibility of the sequences window, the unseen window filled an important-to-me need: It was tiny and could be set to show on all desktops of a virtual window manager without taking a lot of space. Since my normal mode of operation involves two copies of exmh displaying on a 1024x768 vnc session, screen space is at a premium. As things stand now, I have a sequences window that shows a lot more information than I need to have handy and takes up a lot more room than I can ""spare"". I can see that I could like the new sequences window a lot for certain operations. But I'd like a nice uncluttered, tiny window that _only_ shows me info on my unread mail. One possibility that occurs to me would be a button or mouse click that ""shrinks"" the Sequences window to show only the sequences in the ""always show"" list.

Ah, but you've just gotten to the crux of the situation. There's good design and bad design. There's good testing and bad testing. The problem is, anyone can design a good Web form, but nobody does. I think ""best practices"" hasn't caught up on main street Web enablement yet. There's some really great packages on how to do this stuff and in fact the usability people knew that Web forms needed to be fixed 5 years ago, so that's why we got XForms and XHTML. You can shoot yourself in the foot and people usually do. What the problem is, they don't even recognize that they're gimpy--ever. They just keeping trundling along making a mess of everything assured in their job security that they can build Web forms without even caring if they can be used or not beyond their test machine. If you had a piece of software and a security warning came out 5 years ago on it, would you run that software? Wouldn't you have patched or upgraded something so fundamentally broken 4 years and 11 months ago? What I want to know is why would someone use Web forms best practices from 5 years ago? I mean you can get a college degree in that time. Imagine if the next version of Microsoft Windows or Red Hat Linux forced you to use a tiled window manager? Sure, tiled windows were the best we had for a brief period of time, but they are completely useless except for some terminal based replacement applications. The bottom line is, if you can't get across the bridge, then it's broken regardless of whose fault it really is, and it's the business that needs to take responsibility as they are the ones that wanted to put the bridge there in the first place.

Colin Nevin <colin_nevin@yahoo.com>,[ILUG] semaphores on linux RH7.3,"Hi All, I have a question which is a bit tricky and was wondering of anyone has come across this problem before or could point me in the right direction. I am involved in porting a SCO unix application to Linux, and we have encountered a problem with the way semaphores are being handled. The application uses mulitple processes to run application code with the main process known as the bsh which controls all i/o be it screen, or file i/o, syncronisation is handled via semaphores. In certain circumstances the main process and the application child process seem to lock up both waiting for the syncronisation semaphores to change state, I have attached ddd to the processes and it seems that the semaphore code is doing the correct things for syncronisation but the processes stay stuck in the semop() system call. I have also noticed that if I introduce a slight delay between changing semaphore states the problem goes away, but this causes our entire application to run really sloooww !! lol Is there anything weird or different with the standard implemenation of semaphores on modern linux that could cause a semop() to fail to pick up the change in state in a semaphore immediately? Setting sem_flg = IPC_NOWAIT and checking for errno == EAGAIN and recalling semop() if the semop() call fails (-1) also fixes the problem but again system performance goes down the toilet. both the parent controlling process run as the same uid, and the parent creates the semaphores with permissions 0666.

Tim Chapman <timc@2ubh.com>,[zzzzteana] White Horse vandalised,"http://yorkshirepost.co.uk/ed/front/481722 Pro-hunt activists target top sight ONE of Yorkshire's most famous sights yesterday became one of the first targets in bizarre attacks on White Horse landmarks linked to the hunting debate. Villagers near Thirsk could not believe their eyes when they woke yesterday to find the famous White Horse of Kilburn had acquired a rider during the night. In another incident, the Uffington white horse in Oxfordshire had a huntsman and three hounds added to the ancient figure, which is thought to represent a Celtic god or tribal symbol. Pro-hunt activists in the Real Countryside Alliance (RCA)  a radical alternative to the better-known Countryside Alliance  admitted responsibility last night for targeting the two images. The 314ft by 228ft landmark at Kilburn has been lovingly preserved since it was carved in the limestone by schoolmaster John Hodgson and his pupils in 1857. But during Monday night someone nailed on a massive figure of a huntsman with a horn  which had been cut to scale out of a single piece of white carpet. It was removed yesterday by members of Kilburn White Horse Association, who found a Countryside Alliance badge attached to the carpet. John Roberts of the association said: ""It has obviously been very well organised. It was a well crafted piece of kit: a figure of a huntsman with a horn cut out of carpets. ""It was big and impressive and could be seen for miles about. They tied it to bushes at the top and nailed it down. It caused all the stone chippings to be pushed downwards, which will help turn the white horse grey. It will not get another refit for another year. ""Whoever did it must have come with a vehicle  a tractor and trailer or a lorry  because the carpet must have come in one piece. It was extremely well planned and took several people an hour and a half to get it off."" The sculpture needs constant work because, unlike chalk horses in the south of England, it is cut into limestone which is the wrong colour and needs whitening. Mr Roberts added: ""The damage as such is not great but it adds to the deterioration, which means it will need more work next time. ""We would have more sympathy if, having made the point, they would come to take it away again because it was a major job."" Andy Wilson, chief executive of the North York Moors National Park, said: ""It is a scheduled ancient monument and the local residents are very proud of it and go to enormous trouble to keep it white. There is also careful consideration of what shape it should be kept with the constant growth of vegetation so you can understand the alarm and regret at any changes. There has not been a cut in the turf  which would be much more of a problem. It would seem it was carefully plotted beforehand."" An RCA spokesman said: ""Some people in the country are getting very frustrated at the inaction. All we want is Ministers to take notice. Marches don't seem to be doing anything good."" The Countryside Alliance said it did not have any part in the action. Spokesman Adrian Yelland said: ""The Countryside Alliance only ever advocates campaigning that is lawful and dissociates itself from acts of vandalism and regrets any damage that may have been caused by this incident."" The incident follows graffiti on road signs and motorway bridges in Yorkshire thought to be RCA work. ------------------------ Yahoo!

Spiders have multiple eyes, ears, noses and tongues which Peter Parker did not visibly have. There have been a few attempts to explain his heightened reflexes, from the biological to hidden methamphetamine use, but none seem to do the spidey sense justice...

An example: Being able to model RF propagation in three dimensions for a metro area when deploying wireless networks. By having every single tree and building detail and similar, you can ""see"" even tiny dead spots due to physical blockage and signal attenuation. Overlay this with fiber map data for yourself and your competitors (when you can glean such data), which is also useful at this resolution, and you have a very slick way of modeling existing network deployments in excruciating detail and optimizing further deployments to maximize coverage and bandwidth.

boingboing <rssfeeds@example.com>,2000+ year old Greek computer reinterpreted,"URL: http://boingboing.net/#85507259 Date: Not supplied The Antikythera mechanism, recovered off a sunken ship in Greece in 1900, is thought to be a clockwork device to calculate the orbits of the celestial bodies. New analysis of the remaining fragments shows that it was wicked-cool: The Greeks believed in an earth-centric universe and accounted for celestial bodies' motions using elaborate models based on epicycles, in which each body describes a circle (the epicycle) around a point that itself moves in a circle around the earth. Mr Wright found evidence that the Antikythera mechanism would have been able to reproduce the motions of the sun and moon accurately, using an epicyclic model devised by Hipparchus, and of the planets Mercury and Venus, using an epicyclic model derived by Apollonius of Perga. (These models, which predate the mechanism, were subsequently incorporated into the work of Claudius Ptolemy in the second century AD.) A device that just modelled the motions of the sun, moon, Mercury and Venus does not make much sense. But if an upper layer of mechanism had been built, and lost, these extra gears could have modelled the motions of the three other planets known at the time�Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. In other words, the device may have been able to predict the positions of the known celestial bodies for any given date with a respectable degree of accuracy, using bronze pointers on a circular dial with the constellations of the zodiac running round its edge.

Buckminster Fuller I had cited the information theoretic concept of ""elegance"" in my dissertation & did a Google to find the reference and instead found a really great tech report for UoT Knoxville by Bruce MacLennan. He cites Efficiency, Economy, and Elegance, but I think he's wrong. The middle E should be Effectiveness. Otherwise kudos.

MacLennan Computer Science Department University of Tennessee, Knoxville MacLennan@cs.utk.edu Abstract The crucial role played by aesthetics in programming language design and the importance of elegance in programming languages are defended on the basis of analogies with structural engineering, as presented in Billington's The Tower and the Bridge. This report may be used for any nonprofit purpose provided that its source is acknowledged. It will be adapted for inclusion in the third edition of my Principles of Programming Languages. 1.The Value of Analogies 2.Efficiency Seeks to Minimize Resources Used 3.Economy Seeks to Maximize Benefit versus Cost 4.Elegance Symbolizes Good Design 1.For the Designer 2.For the User 5.The Programming Language as Work Environment 6.Acquiring a Sense of Elegance 7.References The Value of Analogies Programming language design is a comparatively new activity - it has existed for less than half a century, so it is often worthwhile to look to older design disciplines to understand better this new activity. Thus, my book Principles of Programming Languages: Design, Evaluation, and Implementation, grew out of a study of teaching methods in architecture, primarily, but also of pedagogy in other disciplines, such as aircraft design. Perhaps you have also seen analogies drawn between programming languages and cars (FORTRAN = Model T, C = dune buggy, etc.). These analogies can be very informative, and can serve as ``intuition pumps'' to enhance our creativity, but they cannot be used uncritically because they are, in the end, just analogies. Ultimately our design decisions must be based on more than analogies, since analogies can be misleading as well as informative. In this essay I'll address the role of aesthetics in programming language design, but I will base my remarks on a book about structural engineering, The Tower and the Bridge, by David P. Billington. Although there are many differences between bridges and programming languages, we will find that many ideas and insights transfer rather directly. According to Billington, there are three values common to many technological activities, which we can call ``the three E's'': Efficiency, Economy and Elegance. These values correspond to three dimensions of technology, which Billington calls the scientific, social and symbolic dimensions (the three S's). We will consider each in turn. Efficiency Seeks to Minimize Resources Used In structural engineering, efficiency deals with the amount of material used; the basic criterion is safety and the issues are scientific (strength of materials, disposition of forces, etc.). Similarly, in programming language design, efficiency is a scientific question dealing with the use of resources. There are many examples where efficiency considerations influenced programming language design (some are reviewed in my Principles of Programming Languages). In the early days, the resources to be minimized were often runtime memory usage and processing time, although compile-time resource utilization was also relevant. In other cases the resource economized was programmer typing time, and there are well-known cases in which this compromised safety (e.g. FORTRAN's implicit declarations). There are also many well-known cases in which security (i.e. safety) was sacrificed for the sake of efficiency by neglecting runtime error checking (e.g. array bounds checking). Efficiency issues often can be quantified in terms of computer memory or time, but we must be careful that we are not comparing apples and oranges. Compile time is not interchangeable run time, and neither one is the same as programmer time. Similarly, computer memory cannot be traded off against computer time unless both are reduced to a common denominator, such as money, but this brings in economic considerations, to which we now turn. Economy Seeks to Maximize Benefit versus Cost Whereas efficiency is a scientific issue, economy is a social issue. In structural engineering, economy seeks to maximize social benefit compared to its cost. (This is especially appropriate since structures like bridges are usually built at public expense for the benefit of the public.) In programming language design, the ``public'' that must be satisfied is the programming community that will use the language and the institutions for which these programmers work. Economic tradeoffs are hard to make because economic values change and are difficult to predict. For example, the shift from first to second generation programming languages was largely a result of a decrease in the cost of computer time compared to programmer time, the shift from the second to the third generation involved the increasing cost of residual bugs in programs, and the fourth generation reflected the increasing cost of program maintenance compared to program development. Other social factors involved in the success or failure of a programming language include: whether major manufacturers support the language, whether prestigious universities teach it, whether it is approved in some way by influential organizations (such as the US Department of Defense), whether it has been standardized, whether it comes to be perceived as a ``real'' language (used by ``real programmers'') or as a ``toy'' language (used by novices or dilettantes), and so forth. As can be seen from the historical remarks in my Principles, social factors are frequently more important than scientific factors in determining the success or failure of a programming language. Often economic issues can be quantified in terms of money, but the monetary values of costs and benefits are often unstable and unpredictable because they depend on changing market forces. Also, many social issues, from dissatisfaction with poorly designed software to human misery resulting from system failures, are inaccurately represented by the single dimension of monetary cost. All kinds of ``cost'' and ``benefit'' must be considered in seeking an economical design. Elegance Symbolizes Good Design ``Elegance? Who cares about elegance?'' snorts the hard-nosed engineer, but Billington shows clearly the critical role of elegance in ``hard-nosed'' engineering. For the Designer It is well-known that feature interaction poses a serious problem for language designers because of the difficulty of analyzing all the possible interactions of features in a language (see my Principles for examples). Structural engineers face similar problems of analytic complexity, but Billington observes that the best designers don't make extensive use of computer models and calculation. One reason is that mathematical analysis is always incomplete. The engineer must make a decision about which variables are significant and which are not, and an analysis may lead to incorrect conclusions if this decision is not made well. Also, equations are often simplified (e.g., made linear) to make their analysis feasible, and this is another potential source of error. Because of these limitations, engineers that depend on mathematical analysis may overdesign a structure to compensate for unforeseen effects left out of the analysis. Thus the price of safety is additional material and increased cost (i.e. decreased efficiency and economy). Similarly in programming language design, the limitations of the analytic approach often force us to make a choice between an under-engineered design, in which we run the risk of unanticipated interactions, and an over-engineered design, in which we have confidence, but which is inefficient or uneconomical. Many people have seen the famous film of the collapse in 1940 of the four-month-old Tacoma Narrows bridge; it vibrated itself to pieces in a storm because aerodynamical stability had not been considered in its design. Billington explains that this accident, along with a number of less dramatic bridge failures, was a consequence of an increasing use of theoretical analyses that began in the 1920s. However, the very problem that destroyed the Tacoma Narrows bridge had been anticipated and avoided a century before by bridge designers who were guided by aesthetic principles. According to Billington, the best structural engineers do not rely on mathematical analysis (although they do not abandon it altogether). Rather, their design activity is guided by a sense of elegance. This is because solutions to structural engineering problems are usually greatly underdetermined, that is, there are many possible solutions to a particular problem, such as bridging a particular river. Therefore, expert designers restrict their attention to designs in which the interaction of the forces is easy to see. The design looks unbalanced if the forces are unbalanced, and the design looks stable if it is stable. The general principle is that designs that look good will also be good, and therefore the design process can be guided by aesthetics without extensive (but incomplete) mathematical analysis. Billington expresses this idea by inverting the old architectural maxim and asserting that, in structural design, function follows form. He adds (p. 21), ``When the form is well chosen, its analysis becomes astoundingly simple.'' In other words, the choice of form is open and free, so we should pick forms where elegant design expresses good design (i.e. efficient and economical design). If we do so, then we can let aesthetics guide design. The same applies to programming language design. By restricting our attention to designs in which the interaction of features is manifest - in which good interactions look good, and bad interactions look bad - we can let our aesthetic sense guide our design and we can be much more confident that we have a good design, without having to check all the possible interactions. For the User In this case, what's good for the designer also is good for the user. Nobody is comfortable crossing a bridge that looks like it will collapse at any moment, and nobody is comfortable using a programming language in which features may ``explode'' if combined in the wrong way. The manifest balance of forces in a well-designed bridge gives us confidence when we cross it. So also, the manifestly good design of our programming language should reinforce our confidence when we program in it, because we have (well-justified) confidence in the consequences of our actions. We accomplish little by covering an unbalanced structure in a beautiful facade. When the bridge is unable to sustain the load for which it was designed, and collapses, it won't much matter that it was beautiful on the outside. So also in programming languages. If the elegance is only superficial, that is, if it is not the manifestation of a deep coherence in the design, then programmers will quickly see through the illusion and loose their (unwarranted) confidence. In summary, good designers choose to work in a region of the design space where good designs look good. As a consequence, these designers can rely on their aesthetic sense, as can the users of the structures (bridges or programming languages) they design. We may miss out on some good designs this way, but they are of limited value unless both the designer and the user can be confident that they are good designs. We may summarize the preceding discussion in a maxim analogous to those in my Principles of Programming Languages: The Elegance Principle Confine your attention to designs that look good because they are good. The Programming Language as Work Environment There are other reasons that elegance is relevant to a well-engineered programming language. The programming language is something the professional programmer will live with - even live in. It should feel comfortable and safe, like a well-designed home or office; in this way it can contribute to the quality of the activities that take place within it. Would you work better in an oriental garden or a sweatshop? A programming language should be a joy to use. This will encourage its use and decrease the programmer's fatigue and frustration. The programming language should not be a hindrance, but should serve more as a collaborator, encouraging programmers to do their jobs better. As some automobiles are ``driving machines'' and work as a natural extension of the driver, so a programming language should be a ``programming machine'' by encouraging the programmer to acquire the smooth competence and seemingly effortless skill of a virtuoso. The programming language should invite the programmer to design elegant, efficient and economical programs. Through its aesthetic dimension a programming language symbolizes many values. For example, in the variety of its features it may symbolize profligate excess, sparing economy or asceticism; the kind of its features may represent intellectual sophistication, down-to-earth practicality or ignorant crudeness. Thus a programming language can promote a set of values. By embodying certain values, it encourages us to think about them; by neglecting or negating other values, it allows them to recede into the background and out of our attention. Out of sight, out of mind. Acquiring a Sense of Elegance Aesthetics is notoriously difficult to teach, so you may wonder how you are supposed to acquire that refined sense of elegance necessary to good design. Billington observes that this sense is acquired through extensive experience in design, which, especially in Europe, is encouraged by a competitive process for choosing bridge designers. Because of it, structural engineers design many more bridges than they build, and they learn from each competition they loose by comparing their own designs with those of the winner and other losers. The public also critiques the competing designs, and in this way becomes more educated; their sense of elegance develops along with that of the designers. So also, to improve as a programming language designer you should design many languages - design obsessively - and criticize, revise and discard your designs. You should also evaluate and criticize other people's designs and try to improve them. In this way you will acquire the body of experience you will need when the ``real thing'' comes along.

Rohit Khare <khare@alumni.caltech.edu>,why is decentralization worth worrying about?,"Why am I so passionate about decentralization? Because I believe some of today’s most profound problems with networked applications are caused by centralization. Generically, a centralized political or economic system permits only one answer to a question, while decentralization permits many separate agents to hold different opinions of the same matter. In the specific context of software, centralized variables can only contain one valid value at a time. That limits us to only representing information A) according to the beliefs of a single agency, and B) that changes more slowly than it takes to propagate. Nevertheless, centralization is the basis for today’s most popular architectural style for developing network applications: client-server interaction using request-response communication protocols. I believe these are profound limitations, which we are already encountering in practice. Spam, for example, is in the eye of the beholder, yet our email protocols and tools do not acknowledge the separate interests of senders and receivers. Slamming, for another, unfairly advantages the bidder with the lowest-latency connection to a centralized auction server. Sharing ad-hoc wireless networks is yet a third example of decentralized resource allocation. Furthermore, as abstract as centralization-induced failures might seem today, these limits will _not_ improve as the cost of computing, storage, and communication bandwidth continue to plummet. Instead, the speed of light and human independence constitute _fundamental_ limits to centralized information representation, and hence centralized software architecture.",0

Sometimes the people I talk to cannot locate the account in their system and tell me that the phone number doesn't exist. Some people are able to locate the account but say that it has been disconnected and there is no way we could get a bill sent to us for that account. Some people can locate the account and verify that the line has been disconnected for three years and that the amount owed is $0.00 and then they say somthing along the lines of ""Huh?"" or ""I'm not sure what's going on... Hold please."" And eventually I have similar conversations with their managers and the account representatives and billing people and their managers and their managers' managers ad naseum. The outcome of every phone call is that they'll ""look into it"" and fix the problem and I might receive one or two more bills depending on when it's resolved. So I wait a month or two and send the bills back marked ""Not at this address, please fsck off."" and then eventually call them back and go through the whole process again. Lately I just explain to the phone jockeys that I know it's not their fault and I'm not mad at them and it's just not their day because I'm about to give them hell.

Your first example is a good one, because I really think it's even easier currently : 1. Leave your current kernel as-is 2. Get the ""alsa-driver"" source rpm 3. Rebuild and install resulting packages Drivers that are written to be easily compiled as modules (like ltmodem, NVidia, ALSA etc.) can easily be repackaged separately as rpms and ported as easily for various kernel rpms from the source rpm. Also, what you describe is sort of the opposite of what rpm packaging is in my mind. I see it more as a ""one size fits all"" achievement in the general case. And kernel isn't an exception (although there are packages optimized for various processors) since they all come with just about all the modules you'll ever need. Make that ""one size fits many"" then if you want ;-) Last but not least : The kernel is something I'm trying to keep away from in my packaging since I really don't want to see newbies screwing up their systems because of packages on my website... same goes for GNOME, KDE and other major bits of the distribution since I also want people who happily use my packages to be able to upgrade to the next Red Hat Linux release without having their system turned into another Ximian mess.

Also, he views historical American approaches to foreign policy as a bundle of three fibers: Hamiltonian - We should only get involved in foreign adventures to preserve balances of power. Wilsonian - We should only get involved in foreign adventures to further democracy, etc. Jacksonian - We should never get involved in foreign adventures. Unless we're attacked. Then we go Rambo. He has tactfully left out the hard realists*; as for the rest I gather wilsonians play the idealists, and hamiltonians act where values and interests intersect, and jacksonians act only when values and interests overlap. Kissinger himself seems to be a Hamiltonian; much of the book is about how he thinks we ought to be shaping the balance of power in various foreign regions. Maybe I've been too affected by Kant, but I can't see that such a strategy works unless one can count on a Bismarck runnning it: how lopsided does the US look if everyone tries to run a balance of power politics? - -Dave * > The road to empire leads to domestic decay because, in time, the claims > of omnipotence erode domestic restraints.

Kings and tyrants generically have followed the same power politics: garner popular support by keeping potential oligarchs down. In other traditions, a king is a legitimate tyrant, and a tyrant an illegitimate king. In the US, I'd hope that we, like Samuel, wouldn't naturally make such fine distinctions.",0

The biggest problem with over regulation is the costs can be invisible. It also has the ability to single out particular people, while over spending spreads the damage more evenly. Rent control would be an example of a regulation solution that is in general worse than spending tons of money on public housing. As for the definition of a liberal being someone who seeks to impose both, I find no fault in that definition whatsoever. The opinion that EITHER we are spending too much OR we have too much regulation is pretty much anathema to liberal politics. Finally, those who argue that there are private replacements for much government regulation are not saying that a state of nature (no private replacements, no government regulation) is better than government regulation itself. And in my experience people who label themselves 'Green' (which does not include everyone who loves trees and thinks smokestacks are ugly) is a watermelon. > -----Original Message----- > From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of Geege > Schuman > > funny. i read it as green = red, as in accounting, as in fiscally > irresponsible. which do you think is the worse indictment - > overregulation > or overspending? there are many (dickheads) who buy into the > neo-conservative media's (fox's) definiton of ""liberal"" as ""one who seeks > to > impose both.""",0

Yeah, assuming approximately equal populations. But that obscures the different modes of promiscuity. Both the person who gives sex for money or power or companionship and the person who uses money and power and companionship to get sex are promiscuous, in the broadest sense of the word. But their motives and behavior are quite different. Langur monkeys were the example in the cited article. ""Dominant males .. kill babies that are not their own."" ""The dominant male monkey .. seeks to defend his harem of females."" But cozying up to the current dominant male isn't the best strategy for female langurs, because ""dominant males are dethroned by rivals every 27 months or so."" ""By mating with as many extra-group males as possible, female langurs ensure their offspring against infanticide,"" by the male who is likely next to rule the roost. Maybe it's just me, but that doesn't paint a picture of carefree females engaged in joyously promiscuous couplings.

By the late evening, the BBC and European papers are kicking in. - The site may be created by algorithms - but what about the choice of sites? The most arbitrary dividing line I see in Google's coverage is what is a news site, and what isn't. Slashdot[3] is, for instance, as well as some very obscure[4] newspapers. What about Blues News[5] or Scripting News[6], though? - Big companies spend mucho money paying ""clipping services"" that send them copies of any press coverage they receive.

This is one of those supposedly nautical expressions that seem to be better known through a couple of appearances in fiction than by any actual sailors' usage. It's an exclamation that may allude to a ship striking some rock or other obstacle so hard that her timbers shiver, or shake, so implying a calamity has occurred. It is first recorded as being used by Captain Frederick Marryat in /Jacob Faithful/ in 1835: ""I won't thrash you Tom. Shiver my timbers if I do"". It has gained a firm place in the language because almost fifty years later Robert Louis Stevenson found it to be just the kind of old-salt saying that fitted the character of Long John Silver in /Treasure Island/: ""Cross me, and you'll go where many a good man's gone before you ... some to the yard-arm, shiver my timbers, and some by the board, and all to feed the fishes"".

Well, my point is more that we should aim our rescoring algorithm so that a spam hits 5.0. Any higher does us no good, as it means an FP is a lot harder to recover from, using compensation rules. Spams *will* hit higher than that -- that's just the way the scoring works. but for our code to be effective, and spread the range of scores correctly, we just have to optimise to hit 1 threshold. --j. ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek Welcome to geek heaven. http://thinkgeek.com/sf _______________________________________________ Spamassassin-talk mailing list Spamassassin-talk@lists.sourceforge.net https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-talk",0

Yeah, that's exactly what I was doing--I didn't realize I was incurring administrative pickle bloat this way. I'm specifically trying to make things faster and smaller, so I'm storing individual WordInfo pickles into an anydbm dict (keyed by token). The result is that it's almost 50 times faster to score messages one per run our of procmail (.408s vs 18.851s). However, it *does* say all over the place that the goal of this project isn't to make the fastest or the smallest implementation, so I guess I'll hold off doing any further performance tuning until the goal starts to point more in that direction. .4 seconds is probably fast enough for people to use it in their procmailrc, which is what I was after. > If you're desparate to save memory, write a subclass?

After WriteMakefile() we could add the lines require ExtUtils::MakeMaker; ExtUtils::MakeMaker->VERSION(5.45); to do per hand what 'use ExtUtils::MakeMaker 5.45' does automagically; `perl Makefile.PL` will die with a ""Uncaught exception from user code: ExtUtils::MakeMaker version 5.45 required--this is only version 5.4302 at Makefile.PL line 103."" there but we've got a Makefile.

That's not a very clean approach but could work. We can also overwrite pm_to_blib in the Makefile directly per postamble. We already have a useless line ""pm_to_blib: spamassassin doc/.made"" there. Adding some commands in this section gives some make warnings (""Makefile:933: warning: overriding commands for target `pm_to_blib' Makefile:877: warning: ignoring old commands for target `pm_to_blib'"") but does work. Not a very good solution either. > So I'm *strongly* against the current use of ExtUtils::MakeMaker 5.45 > usage (if this were an Apache project this would be my veto vote), and > really hope we can find another way. The ""use MakeMaker::..."" error message is IMHO quite clear, so I think it's ok to require the user to do a manual update of ExtUtils::MakeMaker before the SA installation. But that's just my opinion ;-) I'll ask on makemaker@perl.org for the best solution.

Of course, if you can manage to get no messages currently selected, then it works fine. | 2) In the main window, the ""+"" key puts you into a ""change | folder"" mode (the first time you use it after starting exmh), | hit a second + and you go to ""set a target"" mode. Type a few | characters of the folder name and hit space for autocomplete. This works, but is not nice if you're not using the keyboard, but just the mouse. Tony: I agree - a nice way to link in one click would be good, and should be easy to add, though currently adding mouse bindings (something like shift right click would be a good choice) is much harder than adding key bindings. But note there's no need to ""undo"" - the way I generally use link, if the desired destination folder isn't the current selected target, is to right click on the target, which selects it and moves the message, (and because I have the ""automatic move to the next message on move or link option set) select the message again, and then ""Link"". Exmh only permits one uncomitted action to be selected for a message at a time, that is, one of delete, move, or link. Selecting any of those implicitly undoes any previous choice from the three (so you cannot achieve a ""move"" by doing a link, then delete, then commit, it needs to be link, commit, delete, commit). (xmh was just the same there incidentally). | How's spring shaping up ""down under""? No meaningful comment from me, I'm not there at the minute. But I'm told that where I'm from it is cold, wet, and miserable, though has been better during the day (sunny days, cold nights) for the past few.

Jason Levine has more links[3] to those involved. I spoke with one of the people who implemented it, and she claims it wasn't a protest as such, more of an inside joke. Point taken: the entire point of an aggregator (and syndication in general) is to make everyone's words look the same. Counterpoint: the default in most weblog systems is to only publish excerpts in RSS feeds; nobody's forcing you to publish full posts. This would probably be a good place to insert a Zen quote about attachment, but my mind is too fuzzy to find it. _Timothy Appnel_: More FFKAR, RDF, and FOAF[4]. FFKAR is &#8220;the format formerly known as RSS&#8221;. Sam has already implemented it[5]. _Nicholas Avenell_: ESF[6]. &#8220;Are you also fed up with the continuing war between RSS 0.9* and 1.0 and 2.0 and whatever else they invent today? Me too. So today I invented the Epistula Syndication Format. ESF. It isn't XML. It isn't RDF. It's just data.&#8221; Sam[7] would love it, then. But Movable Type doesn't support outputting dates in Unix timestamp format[8], which could be an impediment to mainstream acceptance. _Shelley Powers_: Consumer Rights and RSS[9]. &#8220;I'm not buying into RSS 0.9x. I'm not buying into RSS 2.0. I'm not buying into RSS 1.0.

They did decline to mention that the demand for some trades is so great that some of them are demanding university degrees to get in. Just for the record - the average salary for a university graduate (including advanced degree holders) here is C$ 21,000 -- < $14,000 US. No wonder half of San Francisco has set up here - we have a whole whack of call centers that have arrived here in the last couple of years - I think they hire some entry level IT people for around $10 ($6 US) an hour, which of course, fits perfectly for me - my entry level job, in 1986, paid $11.00 an hour. The fundamental difference is that most of the jobs that require a trade are *unionized*.In other words, in this part of the world, for the vast majority of people, union dues are a better investment than tuition. The counter-argument to this is that many college graduates leave for better work elsewhere, but the counter-counter argument is that we are the thin edge (one of several really - prison labor in the US would be another) of third-world wages and work practices coming to North America. I worked at a company that had a 14-year wage freeze. The fact that they could maintain that (and prosper) just says volumes about the economy in this part of the world. I met many people there, like me, who felt that was fine, I can vote with my feet. They didn't quite realize that just about every large employer in the area has similar, or worse, policies. Anyway eventually they started a union drive. During the vote, retired employees were brought in by the employer (rumours were that they were paid the going rate for a vote around here - a bottle of rum) and somehow allowed to vote . The union filed a grievance - which was denied - by a Minister of Labour, who, hey, guess what - used to be a VP at the company. That's free labor markets at work. The business continues to prosper - as I was told when I was there - it is a cash cow as long as the JOA (Joint Operating Agreement) with the competing paper is in place. And if you think that any of those wonderful American companies, out of some free-enterprise belief in competing for the best talent, are going to do anything about that, sorry, most of them received generous subsidies, in return, I'm sure, for an understanding about the labor markets here. > >BTW, if we ever actually *had* free markets in this country, >*including* the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes, >all those smart people in the Forbes 400 would have *more* money, and >there would be *more* self-made people on that list.

A particularly galling example is high-speed internet access. An article I read a couple of years ago that it is an area where the pricing approaches of the IT industry (cheaper, better or you die) and the telecom industry (maintain your monopoly through regulation, and get guaranteed price increases through the same regulators) meet. Sadly to say, the telecom industry seems to have won. The whole entertainment industry/RIAA/Palladium thing seems to be another instance where actually giving value to the customer seems less important than using regulation to reduce competition and substitute products in order to produce profits for the favored few. > >In short, then, economics is not a zero sum game, property is not >theft, the rich don't get rich off the backs of the poor, and >redistributionist labor ""theory"" of value happy horseshit is just >that: horseshit, happy or otherwise. > >To believe otherwise, is -- quite literally, given the time Marx >wrote Capital and the Manifesto -- romantic nonsense. > > I usually agree - but when there's a Republican in office - I feel like they're the biggest believers in the Manifesto, in reverse. Create a reserve pool of labor, reduce the rights of that ""proletariat"" you've just created with bogus ""law and order"" policies , concentrate capital in the hands of a few (ideally people who can get you reelected) and the economy will take care of itself. Oh, and lie - use the word ""compassionate"" a lot. I guess I tend to believe that a certain amount of poverty reduction actually helps a modern capitalist state - the basic economic tenet of the Republic party seems to be the more homeless under each overpass, the more efficient the rest of us will be. And the facts are, for most people in the Western world are declining standards of living, declining benefits, disappearing social safety net, greater working hours, essentially since the entrance of women into the work force (not blaming women in any way, they have a right to work but its now 2 wage-earners in each family and still declining standards of living) is the reality. Again to quote that wonderfully liberal document I keep coming back to - the CIA world factbook - on the US economy: ""Since 1975, practically all the gains in household income have gone to the top 20% of households"" Owen",0

The statues - which are 10 centimetres (4 inches) tall - are in good condition and believed to be hundreds of years old. They were found on Saturday as workers were rebuilding the Po Pich temple about 100 km (65miles) north of the capital, Phnom Penh. The pagoda, in the Batay district of Kampong Thom province, was torn down during the reign of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s and the area became overgrown. Community care Deputy police chief of Kampong Thom province, Hang Sithim, said the statues - three of which were silver and one bronze - were buried in about one metre (3.4ft) of earth and each weigh around 500 grams (1lb). ''I think that these Buddha statues had been buried hundreds of years ago, when the last temple was fully operating,"" Mr Hang Sithim said. Provincial authorities initially planned to take the statues to a nearby town for safekeeping, but opted to allow the Buddhist community at the temple to take care of them. ''We believe they are safe there,'' said Som Somphat, deputy governor of Kampong Thom province. ''The people of Po Pich pledged to treat them with respect and honour.'' Reign of terror A police guard has been placed around the site to protect it from looters. The Khmer Rouge waged civil war in Cambodia between 1970 and 1998 and controlled the country between 1975 and 1979. The regime outlawed religion and destroyed many objects regarded as decadent or culturally impure. About two million people died in the Khmer Rouge's drive to turn Cambodia into a farmers' utopia. ------------------------ Yahoo!

Jef Feltman <feltman@pacbell.net>,RE: Secure Sofware Key,"the only way to insure a safe key is to use all the storage space in the universe. too big to decrypt. my point is there will never be a ""safe"" key. what I would consider is how long does the data need to be protected. if you need to protect the data for longer than 6 months, do not release it to the public. if you are trying to stop the general public (your customer) from coping the data then use what is available on the market. If you want to stop the bootleggers do not release the data to the public. I have never seen a lock that could not be unlocked. the act of unlocking the key gives away it's secret. the tougher the lock the more pissed-off your customers will be. take MS-XP for example. only the home user is forced to register. think of the nightmare if business had to register every copy. how many times have we needed to reinstall our laptop OS? notice the amount of Mac's sold after the XP release. these where mostly home users that converted to Mac OS. the new Audio CD's that have digital copy protection so not play on my computer. does this stop me from copying the CD? no. however it does make me return them and get my money back. the more popular the software the more likely it is to be cracked. jef",0

Since I don't know what you did, exactly, I can't guess. What you seemed to show is that you did *something* clever with headers and that doing so helped (the ""after"" numbers are better than the ""before"" numbers, right?). Assuming that what you did was override what's now tokenizer.Tokenizer.tokenize_headers with some other routine, and didn't call the base Tokenizer.tokenize_headers at all, then you're missing carefully tested treatment of just a few header fields, but adding many dozens of other header fields. There's no question that adding more header fields should help; tokenizer.Tokenizer.tokenize_headers doesn't do so only because my testing corpora are such that I can't add more headers without getting major benefits for bogus reasons. Apart from all that, you said you're skipping Received. By several accounts, that may be the most valuable of all the header fields. I'm (meaning tokenizer.Tokenizer.tokenize_headers) skipping them too for the reason explained above. Offline a week or two ago, Neil Schemenauer reported good results from this scheme: ip_re = re.compile(r'(\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3})') for header in msg.get_all(""received"", ()): for ip in ip_re.findall(header): parts = ip.split(""."") for n in range(1, 5): yield 'received:' + '.'.join(parts[:n]) This makes a lot of sense to me; I just checked it in, but left it disabled for now.",0

Look for ""Zygalski sheets"". By Koerner's* narrative, it wound up being a hybrid affair: Bletchley had mock Enigmas which cycled through the Enigma's ~18k starting positions in a quarter of an hour, but the Germans started using a plugboard which then had ~1.5x10^14 possibilities. The Poles noticed that there were some patterns in the messages which were only possible via certain plugboard settings, and so: > When we have collected several such cards corresponding to different > initial signals ..., we place them in a pile so that the squares > corresponding to the same daily settings are aligned and shine a > light beneath the pile.

Use of $Config is gradually being removed, thankfully. I don't want to see any of that stuff in there if it acn be avoided, as different perl versions jsut vary so much in that stuff. 2. perl has no concept of where the rules could be -- unless they're in the perl libdir (/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.x.x/foo).

This could also be a job for P2P; lots of people would love to devote their spare cycles, bandwidth, and unblocked IP addresses to giving the Chinese unfettered net access. In a sense, this is what the ""peek-a-booty"" project does: http://www.peek-a-booty.org But let's play out the next few moves: Good Guys: Google enables SSL access Bad Guys: Chinese government again blocks all access to Google domains Good Guys: Set up Google proxies on ever-changing set of hosts (peek-a-booty) Bad Guys: Ban SSL (or any unlicensed opaque traffic) at the national firewall Good Guys: Hide Google traffic inside other innocuous-looking activity Bad Guys: Require nationwide installation of client-side NetNannyish software Good Guys: Offer software which disables/spoofs monitoring software Bad Guys: Imprison and harvest organs from people found using monitoring-disabling-software ...and on and on.

[a cheeky letter to the editors of the Economist follows, along with the article I was commenting on... Rohit] In your article about Chinese attempts to censor Google last week (""The Search Goes On"", Sept. 19th), the followup correctly noted that the most subversive aspect of Google's service is not its card catalog, which merely points surfers in the right direction, but the entire library. By maintaining what amounts to a live backup of the entire World Wide Web, if you can get to Google's cache, you can read anything you'd like. The techniques Chinese Internet Service Providers are using to enforce these rules, however, all depend on the fact that traffic to and from Google, or indeed almost all public websites, is unencrypted. Almost all Web browsers, however, include support for Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption for securing credit card numbers and the like. Upgrading to SSL makes it effectively impossible for a 'man-in-the-middle' to meddle; censorship would have to be imposed on each individual computer in China. The only choice left is to either ban the entire site (range of IP addresses), but not the kind of selective filtering reported on in the article. Of course, the additional computing power to encrypt all this traffic costs real money. If the United States is so concerned about the free flow of information, why shouldn't the Broadcasting Board of Governors sponsor an encrypted interface to Google, or for that matter, the rest of the Web? To date, public diplomacy efforts have focused on public-sector programming for the Voice of America, Radio Sawa, and the like. Just imagine if the US government got into the business of subsidizing secure access to private-sector media instead. Nothing illustrates the freedom of the press as much as the wacky excess of the press itself -- and most of it is already salted away at Google and the Internet Archive project.",0

Dave Long <dl@silcom.com>,RE: The Curse of India's Socialism,"> You have multiple generations of > peasants/squatters that cultivate and live on the lands almost as a > human parts of the property package. When I'd read that ""getting legal title can take 20 years"", when I believe that 1 year ought to be more than sufficient, (and helped by the Cairo reference) I'd assumed that we were talking about the urban poor. If I see people living in mansions, or even in suburban subdivisions, I assume they didn't have too much trouble with their titles. If I see people living in shanties and haphazard alleyways, I tend to assume their parcels weren't exactly recorded on the government maps, or paid for with a bank loan, especially when nearby vacant lots have shotgun wielding men presumably intent on keeping them ""development"" free. Now, it may be that ""Manhattanites' view of America"" to say that outside of Metro Manila, Davao, and maybe another city or two (Cebu?), everything else (literally) is the boondocks. But going on that very broad assumption, I guess I'm describing the flip side of Mr. Roger's experience: the paisanos (who leave behind those who remain on a patron's rural land) move to Manila, and (the second assumption) squat in shantytowns there, at least until they can line up a middle-class job. So, going on two large assumptions, I can come up with a scenario under which title would take 20 years: a shantytown arises somewhere in the midst of a section (or whatever the Spanish used to divvy up the land) and it takes decades of arguing to put together a package which somehow can both compensate the owner and record lots for the inhabitants. Just transferring title to an existing lot, between parties who have money, ought not to be a problem. The obvious solution, at least to us barking farting chihuahuas on FoRK, is to ""introduce market mechanisms"". It is left as an exercise to come up with one which works when many of the agents (are perceived to) have negligible NPV. -Dave > [land reform] meant that all the agricultural producers had > to plant crops all the time (profitable or not) ...

The resulting computers are sent to the developing world for activist use. For the Amazonian villages where there's no electricity or where phone lines are scarce, the activists plan to set up free computer labs in the nearby cities. Many cities already have commercial Internet cafes, but they cost about a dollar per hour of use, Henshaw-Plath says, which is about a day's wage for most of the population. The IMC activists plan to ship off these computers to Guayaquil, Ecuador's main port city, by the end of September. Because none of the computers are being sold in Ecuador, and because they're being transferred from an American nonprofit to an Ecuadorian one, the activists won't be charged any international shipping duties on the computers.

According to the Department for Trade and Industry, the average Briton stands head, shoulders, girth and bottoms above their continental partners. The figures come in a new edition of the department's handbook of anthropometric and strength measurements, compiled by ergonomists at the University of Nottingham to help manufacturers design products to fit people's shape. The volume provides 294 measurements ranging from the distance between the inner corners of the eyes to the length of the leg between the crease below the buttock to the crease at the back of the knee. It has discovered that the average British man is 36 millimetres (1 inches) taller than his French counterpart. The mean height of UK citizens is 1,755.1mm (5ft 9in). Among European men only the Dutch are taller, averaging 1,795mm and with a clear height advantage over the US men's average of 1,760.4. The average British woman is 1,620mm tall (just under 5ft 4in), compared with 1,604mm for her French counterpart, 1,610mm for the Italians and 1,619mm for the Germans. Swedish women average 1,640mm, Dutch 1,650mm and Americans 1,626.7mm More disturbingly, British men and women are heavier than all the other nationalities except the Americans, averaging 79.75 kilos for British men and 66.7 for women. The average British woman has a chest measurement of 1,007.8mm (39.7 inches), compared with 965mm for the Italians, 912.6mm for the Japanese and 806mm for Sri Lankans. American women also top this scale with an average of 1,047.2mm. The average British woman's waist is 840.6mm (33 inches) - also second largest behind the Americans. But her bottom at 873.7mm is considerably smaller than the Italians at 916mm who beat the Americans into second place. The average British male foot is 266.8mm long (10.5 inches), 6mm longer than the French and Germans, 3mm more than the Italians and 1mm more than the Swedes. But they are just beaten by the Americans at 267.8mm and massively outstripped by the Dutch at 275mm. However Dutch women have daintier feet than the British, averaging 240mm compared with 241.1mm in the UK (9.5 inches). German women average 242mm, compared with 245mm for the Swedes and 242.1mm for the Americans. The DTI has a less than exhaustive record of ring finger lengths, but on the available evidence the British man's finger at 78.7mm (3.1 inches) is 1.7mm longer than his German counterpart, but 0.2mm shorter than the American average. The British woman's ring finger at 72.6mm is 0.4mm smaller than her German counterpart and 0.3mm smaller than the American. Beverley Norris, research fellow at Nottingham university's institute for occupational ergonomics, said the figures were useful for product designers. The department has recently completed a study of the pulling force needed to open ring pull cans. ------------------------ Yahoo!

The officers seized an automatic rifle the man was carrying, then the man got out of the truck and was taken into custody, NTV said. No other details were immediately available. The man had demanded talks with high government officials, the Interfax and ITAR-Tass news agencies said. Ekho Moskvy radio reported that he wanted to talk with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Police and security forces rushed to the Security Service building, within blocks of the Kremlin, Red Square and the Bolshoi Ballet, and surrounded the man, who claimed to have one and a half tons of explosives, the news agencies said. Negotiations continued for about one and a half hours outside the building, ITAR-Tass and Interfax reported, citing witnesses. The man later drove away from the building, under police escort, and drove to a street near Moscow's Olympic Penta Hotel, where authorities held further negotiations with him, the Moscow police press service said.

The �130million Airbus 340-600 is fitted with a 5ft x 4ft mother and baby room with a plastic table meant for changing nappies. But couples keep wrecking it by sneaking in for a quick bonk. Virgin has replaced the table several times even though the plane only came into service a few weeks ago. It is named Claudia Nine after sexy model Claudia Schiffer, 32, who launched it in July. Now Virgin bosses have asked Airbus to build a stronger table. At first, German engineers responsible for the jet's interior were baffled by the problem. The table is designed to take the weight of a mum and baby. One Airbus worker said: ""We couldn't work it out. Then the penny dropped. It didn't occur to the Germans that this might happen. It caused great amusement."" The firm say the cost of strengthening the tables will be about �200. A Virgin spokeswoman said: ""Those determined to join the Mile High Club will do so despite the lack of comforts. ""We don't mind couples having a good time but this is not something that we would encourage because of air regulations."" The new Airbus is the world's longest airliner, with teasing slogan ""Mine is bigger than yours"". Virgin is using it on flights to the Far East and the US.",0

Sightings have reached record levels in 2002, according to Daniel Bamping, founder of the British Big Cats Society, which in the past 12 months has received more than 800 reports of big cat sightings. During the first six months we have seen an incredible amount of big cat activity. We have now had reports in every single county; the response from the public has been fantastic, Mr Bamping said. Big cats in Britain are real. They are out there, they are breeding; theres more of them. Scotland and Gloucestershire are said to be hotspots of big cat activity. Mark Fraser, who heads the societys Scottish arm, said: Lynx are now present in the Scottish countryside; I believe they are established and breeding. I dont want to hazard a guess at the numbers; suffice it to say there are several hotspots, notably Fife, Aberdeenshire, Inverness and the Borders. Next month the society plans to unveil its full dossier of evidence, which includes two dead wild cats, pictures of paw prints and tree scratchings, as well as stories of a horse strangely lacerated in West Wales and a man in Gravesham, Kent, who had to beat a hasty retreat to his garage after his hand was cut by a creature the size of a labrador dog, except that it had black hairy tufts on the tips of its ears. The society is taking the sightings seriously. It plans to set up a network of trigger-cameras throughout the country to capture further evidence of the beasts, which it will then present to the Government. It is not, however, clear on what it wants the Government to do about it all. Throwing its weight behind the pro-hunting lobby might be a start.

Easy. First, you'll have to excuse me as I'm still using 2.3.1 (*), so, this may not play well with recent changes. (I did look at 2.5.1, too). And, I just did this off the top of my head (I wanted to see if it (**) still worked), so this is somewhat untested. Adding a menu entry is trivial; add this to your ~/.exmh/exmh-defaults: *Fops.more.m.uentrylist: ketchup *Fops.more.m.l_ketchup: Catch-up all b4 cur *Fops.more.m.c_ketchup: My_Mark2CurSeen Then you just need to provide the source for My_Mark2CurSeen and arrange for Exmh to include it (put it in your ~/.tk/exmh directory in your user.tcl; or in pick.patch if you enable the ""source hook"" under Prefs->Hacking Support) It's going to look something like this: proc My_Mark2CurSeen {} { global exmh pick msg Exmh_Status ""Clearing unseen up to cur..."" red Mh_SetCur $exmh(folder) $msg(id) set pick(ids) [...get message ids for ""pick 1-cur""...] busy PickMarkSeen Exmh_Status ok blue } (that's based upon the guts of Pick_MarkSeen) You need to fill in the code for the [...get...] section; I ran out of time!

Yikes! Purposely provocative, very depressing, with some unbelievably boring passages where the anti-hero writes little stories about animals talking philosophical mumbo-jumbo to each other, quoted inline in full for pages on end.

At one point, some cunt started getting undressed. She took off her T-shirt, then her bra, then her skirt, all the while making unbelievable faces. She pranced around for a few seconds, then she started getting dresesd again because she didn't know what else to do. Anyway she never sleeps with anyone.

Classic X copy-and-paste behavior is that you can only paste what is currently highlighted. In fact, it is the act of highlighting a selection that actually copies that selection into the buffer.

If ab application has a ""copy"" command that you can choose to use separately from the process of highlighting something, that command is something the application authors wrote on their own. (And it it likely that an application that wrote an internal ""copy"" command would also have their own customized ""paste"" command, to make sure the two work together.) Whether the internal (custom) select and paste functions interoperate with the X server's global select and paste functions will vary from program to program, because in each case you are relying on the program's authors' efforts to blend separate systems.

A tall tail or is it a prowling panther? http://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/news/weird/display.var.633939.Bizarre+London.0.html Security cameras at the Gardiner house filmed the cat The Plumstead panther has been spotted just yards from the scene of a sighting made three weeks ago but this time it was caught on camera. Steve Gardiner, 41, claims to have spotted the large cat in his garden in Upton Road, Plumstead, in the sixth reported sighting in Woolwich and Bexley in just four weeks. Mr Gardiner told News Shopper he watched the big cat as it walked alongside the house at about 7.15am, on Wednesday, September 25, while his security cameras captured it on film. The father-of-four described the black cat as about 3ft long and two-and-a-half-foot high, with a large body. He said: ""It prowled past the patio doors moving with all the mannerisms of a hunter. ""It looked at me calmly before moving on."" The bricklayer told how his work colleagues let him know News Shopper had been following the big cat story so he decided to call our offices with news of the sighting. His wife, Karen, 41, later checked the tape which had captured grainy images of the large cat prowling through their garden. She said: ""I feel sorry for it not living in its natural habitat I'd hate for it to get hurt."" Mr Gardiner told how he is convinced of the cat's existence saying how their usually quiet 18-year-old dog barks at ""nothing"" in the garden but barked that morning. He warned: ""I don't think these cats are dangerous but, if cornered, they might jump you."" Sightings of the large black cat are being reported all over the Plumstead Common and Shooters Hill as well at the Bexley area.

"""Crist J. Clark"" <crist.clark@attbi.com>","[SAtalk] Reject, Blackhole, or Fake No-User?","This is not directly SpamAssassin related, but more of a general dealing-with-SPAM issue. What is the best way to deal with SPAM during the SMTP transaction? There are domains and addresses that I know are SPAM at the 'MAIL FROM' and can deal with at the SMTP level. I have been, and I think most people, respond with a 5.7.1 code, a ""permanent"" error. That pretty much means, ""Don't bother to try from that address again, you'll get the same error."" People often add cathartic messages to accompany the 550 like, ""Spammers must die."" But this might not be the best way to go. You are telling the spammers that you are on to them. This may cause them to try other methods to get around your blocks. Is it perhaps better to blackhole the mail? That is, act like everything is OK during the SMTP transaction, but then just drop the mail into the bitbucket. (This is generally how SpamAssassin works since almost everyone uses it after the SMTP transaction has completed successfully.) Spammer thinks everything is going fine and has no reason to try new methods. Then there is a third possibility. Instead of returning a 550 code indicating you're on to the spammer, fake a 5.1.1 response which is saying ""mailbox does not exist."" This would be in the hopes that some spammers out there actually remove names reported as non-existent from their lists. I know, a slim hope, but even if only a few do, it can lower the incidence. So, what are the arguments for each? Do spammers even look at _any_ of the bounce messages they get? The volume of bounces must be huge. Personally, I'm starting to think blackholes are the way to go... But sending back that ""Spammer die, die, die,"" or stock ""Access DEE-NIED!"" (my ephasis added) message can be pretty satisfying. ;) -- Crist J.

Rohit Khare <khare@alumni.caltech.edu>,How about subsidizing SSL access to Google?,"[a cheeky letter to the editors of the Economist follows, along with the article I was commenting on... Rohit] In your article about Chinese attempts to censor Google last week (""The Search Goes On"", Sept. 19th), the followup correctly noted that the most subversive aspect of Google's service is not its card catalog, which merely points surfers in the right direction, but the entire library. By maintaining what amounts to a live backup of the entire World Wide Web, if you can get to Google's cache, you can read anything you'd like. The techniques Chinese Internet Service Providers are using to enforce these rules, however, all depend on the fact that traffic to and from Google, or indeed almost all public websites, is unencrypted. Almost all Web browsers, however, include support for Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption for securing credit card numbers and the like. Upgrading to SSL makes it effectively impossible for a 'man-in-the-middle' to meddle; censorship would have to be imposed on each individual computer in China. The only choice left is to either ban the entire site (range of IP addresses), but not the kind of selective filtering reported on in the article. Of course, the additional computing power to encrypt all this traffic costs real money. If the United States is so concerned about the free flow of information, why shouldn't the Broadcasting Board of Governors sponsor an encrypted interface to Google, or for that matter, the rest of the Web? To date, public diplomacy efforts have focused on public-sector programming for the Voice of America, Radio Sawa, and the like. Just imagine if the US government got into the business of subsidizing secure access to private-sector media instead. Nothing illustrates the freedom of the press as much as the wacky excess of the press itself -- and most of it is already salted away at Google and the Internet Archive project.",0

Tom <tomwhore@slack.net>,GPL limits put to a test,"XviD [1] is a project to make GPL divx codecs. Sigma Designs [1] is a company looking to put out hardware to playback, amongst other things, divx files. Problem is Sigma is using XviDs gpled code in ways not very gpl. The results....XviD stops work on thier code and ask the users to put preasure on Sigma to honor the GPL. Some notes from other places.... >>From Doom9 [3] ""XviD development has been stopped! The Sigma Designs REALMagic MPEG-4 Video Codec contains wide portions of code taken from the XviD project. Soon after the initial release of the REALMagic codec the XviD developers have contacted Sigma and informed them about the GPL violation (for those who don't know, XviD is distributed under the GNU Public License - GPL - which demands that if you modify a GPL program you have to release it under the GPL, which in this case means that the source code of the Sigma codec must be freely available). Sigma promised to replace the stolen code, but the new version of the codec which was released this month only disguises the stolen code, it was not actually removed. Sigma was once again contacted and asked to remove the offending code but until today nothing has happened. Therefore the XviD team is now turning to the public in the hope to receive wide public support in their efforts to convince Sigma Designs to respect the terms of the GPL. And until the matter has been resolved XviD development will not continue. That being said I hope all the forum members who saw their threads about the Sigma Codecs being closed will understand our motivation now. Internally we already knew what was going on but since the XviD authors first wanted to try and resolve this internally we respected their wishes and kept quiet about the matter at hand. [Update] Sigma has issued a press release announcing the availability of the source code of their MPEG-4 codec and it's already up for download. However, not a word was lost about the XviD issue and the press release makes one think that the Sigma codec was entirely developed by Sigma so we might be hearing more about this. [Update] I found a GPL notice in some of the source code files, but it also looks like Sigma placed their own copyright lines there and XviD doesn't get any credit in the source either. The GPL notice also collides with Sigma's Software Licensing Agreement that you have to sign before downloading codec or source. On on the same issue DivXNetworks said they'd fully support XviD in this issue and apparently DXn's relationship with Sigma didn't really work out either, as Sigma's Xcard is not as DivX compatible as it was advertised. [Update]First an update on the XviD situation. The release of the Sigma source code does not mean it's all over, it's far from being over. The license agreement which you have to agree to before you can download, and install the codec is not compatible with the GPL. Furthermore, it can now clearly be seen (download the source code and have a look for yourself) that the Sigma codec is pretty much a copy of the XviD codec, but all the copyright notices of the original developers have been removed and replaced. This does not only violate the GPL but copyright laws - you can't just take a program, change a few lines and change the copyright statements, you only have copyright protection for the parts you wrote on your own. And related to this the Sigma codec also contains code taken from the OpenDivX project, the files were outfitted with 2 different copyright notices which is quite funny.""

AbiWord supports exporting to PalmDoc (.pdb) which is about as PalmOS-friendly as you can get. never tried/needed it, but it's listed there in the ""Save As"" dialog box.

I run two copies of exmh, one at work, one at home. They both display on a ""virtual X server"" created by vncserver on the home box. I connect to that virtual X server using vncviewer wherever I happen to be. The VNC connection is tunneled over ssh and is carried over the Internet via an IPSEC appliance. That gives me access to both home and work email from either place without the complications involved in having two copies of exmh working on the same set of folders.

Answering that requires fairly complete knowledge of the business model. But, in all probability: no, it isn't usually worth it. So, it comes down to how difficult you want to make the cracker's job. If the product requires occasional authentication, simple copying won't work; the product has to be cracked. In which case, the issue is whether you're actually going to enter into battle with the crackers, or just make sure that it isn't trivial. A lot of it comes down to your customer base. Teenage kids tend to be more concerned about cost and less concerned about viruses/trojans, and so more willing to use warez. Fortune-500 corporations are likely to view matters differently. > Does it really make it more secure ? Yes; software techniques will only get you so far. Actually, the same is ultimately true for hardware, but cracking hardware is likely to require resources other than just labour. Almost (?) anything can be reverse engineered. But it may be possible to ensure that doing so is uneconomical. > Look at the DVDs.

I was trying to figure out a way to do it within the mechanism of rpm (like the ""--with"" switches), but for some reason didn't think of using ""--define"". My computer is currently gone for repairs, but once it's back, I'll rewrite the specfile, add support for kernel-smp, and email it to the list for further criticism :) As far as requiring kernel-source, I don't feel it's a big problem. If you're gonna go to the trouble of packaging custom kernels into rpms, it's not a far stretch to package the source tree too (as I currently do). Also, I've found that the alsa-driver source needs a usb-related patch to compile under the latest test kernels (2.4.20-preX). Are other people seeing the same thing, or is this just a problem with my setup? gary P.S. If I didn't mention it before, thanks for the alsa packages!

Tim Chapman <timc@2ubh.com>,[zzzzteana] Lioness adopts fifth antelope,"http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,806579,00.html Lioness adopts fifth antelope Rory Carroll, Africa correspondent Tuesday October 8, 2002 The Guardian Kamuniak the dysfunctional lioness has forfeited another meal by adopting her fifth baby oryx this year, an aberration of nature which has baffled wildlife experts. The young lioness in the Samburu national park in northern Kenay adopted her latest baby at the weekend, a wildlife service warden said yesterday. Each time Kamuniak, whose name means ""the blessed one"" in the local Samburu tongue, has tried to protect the antelopes from other predators and allowed the natural mothers to feed them. Unfortunately for her, one oryx ended up in the belly of a male lion while Kamuniak slept; the others were either rescued by wardens or retrieved by their natural mothers. The wardens think the latest adoptee, nicknamed Naisimari (""taken by force""), was adopted at the weekend. ""She must have adopted her on Sunday because they are in harmony,"" said Gabriel Lepariyo, a warden. Naisimari's natural mother has been seen shadowing the odd couple at a distance. Theories to explain the phenonemon abound: not having her own cubs, Kamuniak is lonely; she is colour-blind and short-sighted and thinks the calves are cubs; the oryx were too frail to flee, breaking the classic prey behaviour and confusing the hunter; Kamuniak wants to be a vegetarian; Kamuniak wants to be loved. ------------------------ Yahoo!

Ahm, if you don't object to using a mouse for such things, exmh has the ability to insert different sigs on demand. Create a bunch of different sig files, all beginning with .signature, and at start up, exmh will load them all. In the Sedit window, you'll see a Sign... menu item which will allow you to select between each of the listed .signature files for *that* e-mail. You can actually use several if you'd like (though I don't remember what Preferences... option allows for this). However, the signature gets added on send, not inserted directly into the existing Sedit window prior to composition. I currently have 6 different sig files I can choose between. Additionally, if a .signature file has the execute bit turned on, exmh will attempt to execute the file and use the stdout of the script as your signature. I hope this helps some. -- Seeya, Paul -- It may look like I'm just sitting here doing nothing, but I'm really actively waiting for all my problems to go away.

Gregory Alan Bolcer <gbolcer@endeavors.com>,Webex Endeavors,"We have a partnership with Webex. We use their serivce for cross-firewall app sharing--something that Netmeeting/Messenger and Sametime require a lot of configuration of firewalls, authentications, access controls and user training for. Now Webex has invites, instant meeting launch without any configuration. Users like it as now they have something to do in between Web conferences and places to store and author documents, reschedule meetings, relaunch meetings. Webex likes it as people are signed on all the time. Greg September 19, 2002 Tadpole's Secure Web Software Subsidiary Endeavors Technology Teams With Web Meetings Leader WebEx Communications To Provide Best-of-Breed Solution For Extended Group Collaboration During and Between Online Meetings Web meetings raise the quality of team interaction and communications for users of the Web's secure, P2P collaboration network ### Tadpole Technology plc, the mobile computing and network infrastructure group, today announces that its web collaboration subsidiary, Endeavors Technology, Inc., has teamed with Web meetings leader, WebEx Communications,Inc. to help professionals make better use of corporate time and resources, and gain competitive advantage. By integrating the advanced communications capabilities of the WebEx platform with Endeavors' secure P2P collaboration network, Endeavors has created a new method of world-class teamwork and interaction without the hassle of travel. With the rapid growth in popularity of Web meetings, the rationale for this world-class relationship stems from the growing need for workgroups around the world to maintain the quality of the team collaboration experience between online meetings. The issue by those preferring not to travel is how to continue to collaborate and share information with team members between meetings rather than depending on intermittent, insecure email and multiple copies of constantly changing documents. Inter-meeting collaboration needs an asynchronous medium, independent of time. In asynchronous mode, a team member can access, read and edit information relevant to the meeting group at his/her convenience rather than having to fit into the schedules and timeframes of others. A secured environment available only to members of a meeting or project is also essential. Endeavors' Magi technology converts the Web into a secure platform for sharing information directly from people's desktops. WebEx meetings can be recorded and reviewed at any time, documents shared in the meeting can be actioned in real-time or at a later date, calendars and project schedules can be updated at any time, and new individuals added to the workgroup at will . all in a secure environment with people working across the globe, inside or outside company firewalls. Magi peer collaboration securely delivers significant benefits to Web meeting participants. Not only can they share and access information at will, but they can also know which other participants are online or ""present."" This enables them to chat and message each other, search across other people's Magi environment, and work jointly on relevant documents highly productively. With Magi collaboration, in tandem with WebEx conferencing, the savings can be huge in terms of travel costs, phone bills, and, most importantly, timely completion of projects and tasks. ""In order to realise the full potential of Web meetings, best-of-breed services are needed to eliminate time and geographical boundaries,"" says Bernard Hulme, Tadpole's group chief executive. ""The powerful combination of Endeavors' Magi and WebEx's communications technologies will assist global work teams to better meet critical business goals and deadlines by maintaining teamwork momentum within and between Web meetings."" ""WebEx is transforming the way businesses use the Web for sales, marketing, training, support and product design,"" says David Farrington, vice president of corporate development at WebEx Communications. ""By integrating the communications capabilities of the WebEx platform with Endeavors' secure collaboration network, Endeavors has created an offering that provides the best in synchronous and asynchronous communications."" About Magi Magi Enterprise 3.0, an award-winning web collaboration system, transforms today's Web into a highly secure inter- and intra-enterprise collaboration network of files and web resources. For the first time, enterprises can implement ad-hoc Virtual Private Networks for collaboration very rapidly and affordably without disrupting existing applications, networks or work practices. Magi Enterprise 3.0 does this by effectively transforming unsecured, ""read-only"" Web networks into two-way trusted and transparent collaboration environments, through the use of such features as cross-firewall connections, advanced data extraction, an intuitive graphical interface, and universal name spaces generating ""follow me URLs"" for mobile professionals.

Finding an individual vehicle in a city might occasionally be possible with 1-m images and might occasionally also be worth the money.

As mentioned elsewhere, even L|Unix users may find an MUA solution easier to use then getting it added to their MTA. (SysOps make programmers look like flaming liberals ;).) My notion of a solution for Windows/Outlook has been, as Guido described, a client-server. Client side does pop3/imap/mapi fetching (of which, I'm only going to implement pop3 initially) potentially on several hosts, spamhams the incoming mail and puts it into one file per message (qmail style?). The MUA accesses this ""eThunk"" as a server to obtain all the ham. Spam is retained in the eThunk and a simple viewer would be used for manual oversight on the spam for ultimate rejection (and training of spam filter) and the ham will go forward (after being used for training) on the next MUA fetch. eThunk would sit on a timer for 'always online' users, but I am not clear on how to support dialup users with this scheme. Outbound mail would use a direct path from the MUA to the MTA. Hopefully all MUAs can split the host fetch/send URL's IMO, end users are likely to be more intested in n-way classification. If this is available, the ""simple viewer"" could be enhanced to support viewing via folders and (at least for me) the Outlook nightmare is over - I would use this as my only MUA. (N.B. according to my recent readings, the best n-way classifier uses something called a ""Support Vector Machine"" (SVM) which is 5-8% more accurate then Naive Bayes (NB) ). I wonder if the focus of spambayes ought not to be a classifier that leaves the fetching and feeding of messages to auxillary code? That way, it could be dropped into whatever harness that suited the user's situation. David LeBlanc Seattle, WA USA",0

"""R. A. Hettinga"" <rah@shipwright.com>",The Next World Order,"http://newyorker.com/fact/content/?020401fa_FACT1 The New Yorker THE NEXT WORLD ORDER by NICHOLAS LEMANN The Bush Administration may have a brand-new doctrine of power. Issue of 2002-04-01 Posted 2002-03-25 When there is a change of command-and not just in government-the new people often persuade themselves that the old people were much worse than anyone suspected. This feeling seems especially intense in the Bush Administration, perhaps because Bill Clinton has been bracketed by a father-son team. It's easy for people in the Administration to believe that, after an unfortunate eight-year interlude, the Bush family has resumed its governance-and about time, too. The Bush Administration's sense that the Clinton years were a waste, or worse, is strongest in the realms of foreign policy and military affairs. Republicans tend to regard Democrats as untrustworthy in defense and foreign policy, anyway, in ways that coincide with what people think of as Clinton's weak points: an eagerness to please, a lack of discipline. Condoleezza Rice, Bush's national-security adviser, wrote an article in Foreign Affairs two years ago in which she contemptuously accused Clinton of ""an extraordinary neglect of the fiduciary responsibilities of the commander in chief."" Most of the top figures in foreign affairs in this Administration also served under the President's father. They took office last year, after what they regard as eight years of small-time flyswatting by Clinton, thinking that they were picking up where they'd left off. Not long ago, I had lunch with-sorry!-a senior Administration foreign-policy official, at a restaurant in Washington called the Oval Room. Early in the lunch, he handed me a twenty-seven- page report, whose cover bore the seal of the Department of Defense, an outline map of the world, and these words: Defense Strategy for the 1990s: The Regional Defense Strategy Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney January 1993 One of the difficulties of working at the highest level of government is communicating its drama. Actors, professional athletes, and even elected politicians train for years, go through a great winnowing, and then perform publicly. People who have titles like Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense are just as ambitious and competitive, have worked just as long and hard, and are often playing for even higher stakes-but what they do all day is go to meetings and write memos and prepare briefings. How, possibly, to explain that some of the documents, including the report that the senior official handed me, which was physically indistinguishable from a high-school term paper, represent the government version of playing Carnegie Hall? After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Dick Cheney, then the Secretary of Defense, set up a ""shop,"" as they say, to think about American foreign policy after the Cold War, at the grand strategic level. The project, whose existence was kept quiet, included people who are now back in the game, at a higher level: among them, Paul Wolfowitz, the Deputy Secretary of Defense; Lewis Libby, Cheney's chief of staff; and Eric Edelman, a senior foreign-policy adviser to Cheney-generally speaking, a cohesive group of conservatives who regard themselves as bigger-thinking, tougher-minded, and intellectually bolder than most other people in Washington. (Donald Rumsfeld, the Secretary of Defense, shares these characteristics, and has been closely associated with Cheney for more than thirty years.) Colin Powell, then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, mounted a competing, and presumably more ideologically moderate, effort to reimagine American foreign policy and defense. A date was set-May 21, 1990-on which each team would brief Cheney for an hour; Cheney would then brief President Bush, after which Bush would make a foreign-policy address unveiling the new grand strategy. Everybody worked for months on the ""five-twenty-one brief,"" with a sense that the shape of the post-Cold War world was at stake. When Wolfowitz and Powell arrived at Cheney's office on May 21st, Wolfowitz went first, but his briefing lasted far beyond the allotted hour, and Cheney (a hawk who, perhaps, liked what he was hearing) did not call time on him. Powell didn't get to present his alternate version of the future of the United States in the world until a couple of weeks later. Cheney briefed President Bush, using material mostly from Wolfowitz, and Bush prepared his major foreign-policy address. But he delivered it on August 2, 1990, the day that Iraq invaded Kuwait, so nobody noticed. The team kept working. In 1992, the Times got its hands on a version of the material, and published a front-page story saying that the Pentagon envisioned a future in which the United States could, and should, prevent any other nation or alliance from becoming a great power. A few weeks of controversy ensued about the Bush Administration's hawks being ""unilateral""-controversy that Cheney's people put an end to with denials and the counter-leak of an edited, softer version of the same material. As it became apparent that Bush was going to lose to Clinton, the Cheney team's efforts took on the quality of a parting shot. The report that the senior official handed me at lunch had been issued only a few days before Clinton took office. It is a somewhat bland, opaque document-a ""scrubbed,"" meaning unclassified, version of something more candid-but it contained the essential ideas of ""shaping,"" rather than reacting to, the rest of the world, and of preventing the rise of other superpowers. Its tone is one of skepticism about diplomatic partnerships. A more forthright version of the same ideas can be found in a short book titled ""From Containment to Global Leadership?,"" which Zalmay Khalilzad, who joined Cheney's team in 1991 and is now special envoy to Afghanistan, published a couple of years into the Clinton Administration, when he was out of government. It recommends that the United States ""preclude the rise of another global rival for the indefinite future."" Khalilzad writes, ""It is a vital U.S. interest to preclude such a development-i.e., to be willing to use force if necessary for the purpose."" When George W. Bush was campaigning for President, he and the people around him didn't seem to be proposing a great doctrinal shift, along the lines of the policy of containment of the Soviet Union's sphere of influence which the United States maintained during the Cold War. In his first major foreign-policy speech, delivered in November of 1999, Bush declared that ""a President must be a clear-eyed realist,"" a formulation that seems to connote an absence of world-remaking ambition. ""Realism"" is exactly the foreign-policy doctrine that Cheney's Pentagon team rejected, partly because it posits the impossibility of any one country's ever dominating world affairs for any length of time. One gets many reminders in Washington these days of how much the terrorist attacks of September 11th have changed official foreign-policy thinking. Any chief executive, of either party, would probably have done what Bush has done so far-made war on the Taliban and Al Qaeda and enhanced domestic security. It is only now, six months after the attacks, that we are truly entering the realm of Presidential choice, and all indications are that Bush is going to use September 11th as the occasion to launch a new, aggressive American foreign policy that would represent a broad change in direction rather than a specific war on terrorism. All his rhetoric, especially in the two addresses he has given to joint sessions of Congress since September 11th, and all the information about his state of mind which his aides have leaked, indicate that he sees this as the nation's moment of destiny-a perception that the people around him seem to be encouraging, because it enhances Bush's stature and opens the way to more assertive policymaking. Inside government, the reason September 11th appears to have been ""a transformative moment,"" as the senior official I had lunch with put it, is not so much that it revealed the existence of a threat of which officials had previously been unaware as that it drastically reduced the American public's usual resistance to American military involvement overseas, at least for a while. The Clinton Administration, beginning with the ""Black Hawk Down"" operation in Mogadishu, during its first year, operated on the conviction that Americans were highly averse to casualties; the all-bombing Kosovo operation, in Clinton's next-to-last year, was the ideal foreign military adventure. Now that the United States has been attacked, the options are much broader. The senior official approvingly mentioned a 1999 study of casualty aversion by the Triangle Institute for Security Studies, which argued that the ""mass public"" is much less casualty-averse than the military or the civilian élite believes; for example, the study showed that the public would tolerate thirty thousand deaths in a military operation to prevent Iraq from acquiring weapons of mass destruction. (The American death total in the Vietnam War was about fifty-eight thousand.) September 11th presumably reduced casualty aversion even further. Recently, I went to the White House to interview Condoleezza Rice. Rice's Foreign Affairs article from 2000 begins with this declaration: ""The United States has found it exceedingly difficult to define its 'national interest' in the absence of Soviet power."" I asked her whether that is still the case. ""I think the difficulty has passed in defining a role,"" she said immediately. ""I think September 11th was one of those great earthquakes that clarify and sharpen. Events are in much sharper relief."" Like Bush, she said that opposing terrorism and preventing the accumulation of weapons of mass destruction ""in the hands of irresponsible states"" now define the national interest. (The latter goal, by the way, is new-in Bush's speech to Congress on September 20th, America's sole grand purpose was ending terrorism.) We talked in her West Wing office; its tall windows face the part of the White House grounds where television reporters do their standups. In her bearing, Rice seemed less crisply military than she does in public. She looked a little tired, but she was projecting a kind of missionary calm, rather than belligerence. In the Foreign Affairs article, Rice came across as a classic realist, putting forth ""the notions of power politics, great powers, and power balances"" as the proper central concerns of the United States. Now she sounded as if she had moved closer to the one-power idea that Cheney's Pentagon team proposed ten years ago-or, at least, to the idea that the other great powers are now in harmony with the United States, because of the terrorist attacks, and can be induced to remain so. ""Theoretically, the realists would predict that when you have a great power like the United States it would not be long before you had other great powers rising to challenge it or trying to balance against it,"" Rice said. ""And I think what you're seeing is that there's at least a predilection this time to move to productive and coöperative relations with the United States, rather than to try to balance the United States. I actually think that statecraft matters in how it all comes out. It's not all foreordained."" Rice said that she had called together the senior staff people of the National Security Council and asked them to think seriously about ""how do you capitalize on these opportunities"" to fundamentally change American doctrine, and the shape of the world, in the wake of September 11th. ""I really think this period is analogous to 1945 to 1947,"" she said-that is, the period when the containment doctrine took shape-""in that the events so clearly demonstrated that there is a big global threat, and that it's a big global threat to a lot of countries that you would not have normally thought of as being in the coalition. That has started shifting the tectonic plates in international politics. And it's important to try to seize on that and position American interests and institutions and all of that before they harden again."" The National Security Council is legally required to produce an annual document called the National Security Strategy, stating the over-all goals of American policy-another government report whose importance is great but not obvious. The Bush Administration did not produce one last year, as the Clinton Administration did not in its first year. Rice said that she is working on the report now. ""There are two ways to handle this document,"" she told me. ""One is to do it in a kind of minimalist way and just get it out. But it's our view that, since this is going to be the first one for the Bush Administration, it's important. An awful lot has happened since we started this process, prior to 9/11. I can't give you a certain date when it's going to be out, but I would think sometime this spring. And it's important that it be a real statement of what the Bush Administration sees as the strategic direction that it's going."" It seems clear already that Rice will set forth the hope of a more dominant American role in the world than she might have a couple of years ago. Some questions that don't appear to be settled yet, but are obviously being asked, are how much the United States is willing to operate alone in foreign affairs, and how much change it is willing to try to engender inside other countries-and to what end, and with what means. The leak a couple of weeks ago of a new American nuclear posture, adding offensive capability against ""rogue states,"" departed from decades of official adherence to a purely defensive position, and was just one indication of the scope of the reconsideration that is going on. Is the United States now in a position to be redrawing regional maps, especially in the Middle East, and replacing governments by force? Nobody thought that the Bush Administration would be thinking in such ambitious terms, but plainly it is, and with the internal debate to the right of where it was only a few months ago. Just before the 2000 election, a Republican foreign-policy figure suggested to me that a good indication of a Bush Administration's direction in foreign affairs would be who got a higher-ranking job, Paul Wolfowitz or Richard Haass. Haass is another veteran of the first Bush Administration, and an intellectual like Wolfowitz, but much more moderate. In 1997, he published a book titled ""The Reluctant Sheriff,"" in which he poked a little fun at Wolfowitz's famous strategy briefing of the early nineties (he called it the ""Pentagon Paper"") and disagreed with its idea that the United States should try to be the world's only great power over the long term. ""For better or worse, such a goal is beyond our reach,"" Haass wrote. ""It simply is not doable."" Elsewhere in the book, he disagreed with another of the Wolfowitz team's main ideas, that of the United States expanding the ""democratic zone of peace"": ""Primacy is not to be confused with hegemony. The United States cannot compel others to become more democratic."" Haass argued that the United States is becoming less dominant in the world, not more, and suggested ""a revival of what might be called traditional great-power politics."" Wolfowitz got a higher-ranking job than Haass: he is Deputy Secretary of Defense, and Haass is Director of Policy Planning for the State Department- in effect, Colin Powell's big-think guy. Recently, I went to see him in his office at the State Department. On the wall of his waiting room was an array of photographs of every past director of the policy-planning staff, beginning with George Kennan, the father of the containment doctrine and the first holder of the office that Haass now occupies. It's another indication of the way things are moving in Washington that Haass seems to have become more hawkish. I mentioned the title of his book. ""Using the word 'reluctant' was itself reflective of a period when foreign policy seemed secondary, and sacrificing for foreign policy was a hard case to make,"" he said. ""It was written when Bill Clinton was saying, 'It's the economy, stupid'-not 'It's the world, stupid.' Two things are very different now. One, the President has a much easier time making the case that foreign policy matters. Second, at the top of the national-security charts is this notion of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism."" I asked Haass whether there is a doctrine emerging that is as broad as Kennan's containment. ""I think there is,"" he said. ""What you're seeing from this Administration is the emergence of a new principle or body of ideas-I'm not sure it constitutes a doctrine-about what you might call the limits of sovereignty. Sovereignty entails obligations. One is not to massacre your own people. Another is not to support terrorism in any way.

guido@python.org,[Spambayes] Deployment,"Quite independently from testing and tuning the algorithm, I'd like to think about deployment. Eventually, individuals and postmasters should be able to download a spambayes software distribution, answer a few configuration questions about their mail setup, training and false positives, and install it as a filter. A more modest initial goal might be the production of a tool that can easily be used by individuals (since we're more likely to find individuals willing to risk this than postmasters). There are many ways to do this. Some ideas: - A program that acts both as a pop client and a pop server. You configure it by telling it about your real pop servers. You then point your mail reader to the pop server at localhost. When it receives a connection, it connects to the remote pop servers, reads your mail, and gives you only the non-spam. To train it, you'd only need to send it the false negatives somehow; it can assume that anything is ham that you don't say is spam within 48 hours. - A server with a custom protocol that you send a copy of a message and that answers ""spam"" or ""ham"". Then you have a little program that is invoked e.g. by procmail that talks to the server. (The server exists so that it doesn't have to load the pickle with the scoring database for each message. I don't know how big that pickle would be, maybe loading it each time is fine. Or maybe marshalling.) - Your idea here. Takers? How is ESR's bogofilter packaged? SpamAssassin?

What I am specifically referring to is protesters shouting down speakers or making so much noise that it interferes with the speaker. That's wrong, immoral and unethical no matter what the political bent of the speakers and the protesters.

Well, Owen implied the protesters were arrested. Was he just jacking himself off at the expense of other people? Exactly why is it a shame that they were not arrested? Think about what you are saying and what you are telegraphing about your state of mind here. You WANT people to do bad things (ie, police arresting peaceful protesters) if it can help you further your cause? That attitude just sucks.

Sure, just don't whine about getting arrested if you make it a point to get in someone's face. One other comment... Most of the people that are protesting against taking out the Iraqi dictator wouldn't give a rats ass if a nuke went off in NYC.

Martin Adamson <martin@srv0.ems.ed.ac.uk>,[zzzzteana] Fake bank website cons victims,">>From the BBC website - www.bbc.co.uk Tuesday, 8 October, 2002, 09:43 GMT 10:43 UK Fake bank website cons victims West African criminals have used a fake version of a British bank's online service to milk victims of cash, say police. The fake site was used to squeeze more money out of people they had already hooked. The site has been shut down. But UK National Criminal Intelligence Service, (NCIS), said at least two Canadians had lost more than $100,000 after being taken in by the fake website. The scam behind the fake web domain was the familiar one that offers people a share of the huge sums of money they need moved out of various African nations. NCIS said the use of the web was helping the conmen hook victims that would otherwise spot the scam. Convincing site News of this latest scam was revealed by BBC Radio5Live. It found that an unclaimed web domain of a UK bank had been used by conmen to get more cash out their victims. A NCIS spokesman said the domain looked legitimate because it had ""the"" in front of the bank's name. ""I have seen the microsite myself and it's very sophisticated,"" said the NCIS spokesman. ""It's very convincing especially to people not very experienced online."" Once the con was discovered it was quickly shut down. However, the people behind it have not been caught. NCIS does know that at least two people have lost more than $100,000. The bank involved has bought up the domain used in the con as well as many other permutations of its name to limit the chance it could happen again. Domain games Usually people are first hooked in to what has become known as Advanced Fee or 419 fraud by replying to an unsolicited fax or e-mail offering a share of any cash successfully moved out of Africa. The '419' refers to the part of the Nigerian penal code dealing with such crimes. Like any con, there is no money to be moved at all and instead anyone taking the bait is asked to pay increasingly large sums to supposedly bribe uncooperative officials and to smooth the passage of the cash. Although this con has been practiced for years, people still fall victim to it. NCIS estimates that up to five Americans are sitting in hotel lobbies in London everyday waiting to meet people connected with this con. Cutting edge fraud Often the conmen provide fake banking certificates to give the con an air of legitimacy. People tricked into clicking on fake sites But a spokesman for NCIS said fake or spoof websites are now being used in place of the certificates. ""To many people nowadays the cutting edge of banking technology is web technology,"" said the spokesman. One of the first groups of conmen to use this method set up a fake website that supposedly gave victims access to accounts held at the South African Reserve Bank, the country's national bank. Typically, victims are given a login name and password and are encouraged to visit the site so they can see that the cash they are getting a share of has been deposited in their name. But before they can get their hands on the cash, the victims are typically asked to hand over more of their own money to help the transfer go ahead. Once the South African police discovered the ruse they declared it a national priority crime and soon arrested the 18 people behind it. Modern gloss An briefing paper prepared by NCIS in August on organised crime noted that criminals were increasingly turning to the web to lure new victims and give old cons a modern gloss. The NCIS spokesman urged people who have fallen victim to 419 fraud to come forward and help it track down the perpetrators. He said in the last two months it had arrested 24 people overseas involved with this type of fraud. He said any e-mail, fax or letter making an offer that looks to good too be true, undoubtedly is. One of the first companies to fall victim to website spoofing was net payment service Paypal. Conmen set up a fake site and asked people to visit and re-enter their account and credit card details because Paypal had lost the information. The website link included in the e-mail looked legitimate but in fact directed people to a fake domain that gathered details for the conmen's personal use. ------------------------ Yahoo!

Well, I don't really find it consistent at all to use an rpm package built against something that wasn't installed through rpm :-/ What I'd recommend in your case : You should keep at least one original Red Hat Linux kernel (you do just in case, right? ;-)) and install the matching alsa-kernel package as you'll need at least one because of the dependencies. Then for your custom built kernel, simply ""./configure --with-cards=all && make && make install DESTDIR=/tmp/alsa-driver"" from the alsa-driver sources then as root copy all the modules under /tmp/alsa-driver/lib/modules/ to your modules dir and run ""depmod -a"". Of course you can even make it much faster by not compiling all un-needed drivers, as I guess that's one of the reasons one would rebuild his own kernel. I find this the easiest and cleanest way to get around the problem. It's what I've done and what I'll keep doing on my laptop where I'm running a kernel recompiled with ACPI.

Andy <andy@r2-dvd.org>,[zzzzteana] Big cats 'on the increase',"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2220922.stm Big cats are on the loose in Britain and breeding their way towards record numbers, a monitoring group has claimed. The British Big Cats Society said it has received more than 800 reports of animals including pumas, black panthers, leopards and so-called Fen tigers over the past 12 months. And while it admits that many sightings are of nothing more exotic than the average moggy, it claims to have ""firm evidence"" that the majority are real. Society founder Daniel Bamping told BBC News Online he could cope with the critics and doubters, adding: ""I was a sceptic, I thought it was in the same realm as the Loch Ness monster. ""But it's not, they are really out there."" 'Cats with cubs' Mr Bamping said there have been reports of big cats from every corner of the country. Big cat reports Hotspots include Scotland and Gloucestershire January 2002 - Kent man clawed by suspected Lynx November 2001 - farmer reports animals mauled by big cat April 2001 - Lynx captured in north London 1999 - Puma-like cat attacks horse in Wales ""This weekend alone I have had sightings from Wales, the Scottish borders, Kent, the West Midlands, Devon, Somerset and Wiltshire,"" he said. The society claims some of the big cats are breeding with domestic animals. But Mr Bamping said others, particularly lynx and puma, probably exist in sufficient numbers to breed among themselves. ""We have had sightings of cats with cubs,"" he added. 'Trigger camera' The society claims to have evidence proving the cats' existence, including photographs, paw prints, sheep kills and hair samples. But it knows it will have to do even more to convince a sceptical public that it is not spinning them a shaggy cat story. A national ""trigger camera"" project is planned which, the society hopes, will provide footage to prove the existence of the big cats. Mr Bamping said: ""The idea is that the cat will walk past the camera and take a picture of itself."" 'Like dogs' The society believes many of the sighting are of pets released into the wild, or their descendants. Its spokesman Danny Nineham said: ""In the 1960s and 1970s, people had big cats like leopards as pets and they used to walk them like dogs. ""But in 1976 when the Dangerous Wild Animals Act came into force, people released their cats because they did not want to pay for a licence, put them down, or take them to a zoo."" ------------------------ Yahoo!

Most people tend to ignore mails larger than about 250K in spamassassin processing, because it just kills performance. There are some known issues with the parsing (such as the HTML parsing stuff which is much improved in 2.40 which we're soon to release), but nothing that's too likely to be fixed by 2.40. Perhaps in 2.50 though.

I just wanted to say that I am grateful they choose not to publish my forbidden thought. I sent it in a couple of days before the 9/11 commeration. If I had just watched the sentimental network and cable shows on 9/11 my cynical thoughts would have remain unchanged. However, I watch the Frontline show ""Faith and Doubt at Ground Zero"" on PBS. That show tackled head on, with much more courage than I have seen elsewhere, the larger questions about good and evil, about art as an alternate religion (Karlheinz Stockhausen -- 9/11 was a great work of art), and especially the question about how religion has a darker side which when carried to fanatic extremes tends to negate the humanity of the non-believers. I am not a religious person but I stunned at the scope of this program. It talked about the Lutheran minister who spoke at Yankees Stadium on a podium with other religious leaders present who was charged with heresy by his own church for promoting the idea that all religions are equal (presumably the Lutherans have the one true path?). Thanks for listening, I just felt like I needed to put the word out about this program. My shallow comment on Salon and others like it (my boyfriend and I had sex while the towers collapsed) gives me pause about how some of us tend to harden ourselves to the suffering of others.

diveintomark <rssfeeds@example.com>,History of the tilde,"URL: http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/10/04.html#history_of_the_tilde Date: 2002-10-04T00:27:41-05:00 So I was researching the history of the tilde, because D told me that her company just installed a new web proxy that denies access to any URL with a tilde in it. Presumably because the presence of a tilde indicates with remarkable accuracy a personal site, and apparently her employer believes that reading personal sites is not an appropriate use of company time. Which, to be honest, is probably accurate, given the nature of her work. But never mind that. I don't want to talk about corporate politics. I want to talk about the tilde. Every command-line-loving geek will tell you that ~ stands for &#8220;home directory&#8221;, and cd ~ will take you to your home directory. (cd ~username will take you to someone else's, except on Mac OS X, where it will take you to their Public file sharing directory.) It is from this heritage that we can trace the present-day practice of using tildes in URLs to denote personal pages, since one single system-wide configuration allowed individual users to have their own web sites by storing files in their own home directory. Or, more commonly now that Apache has taken over the world, in their public_html subdirectory, except on Mac OS X, where if you turn on web sharing and point your browser to http://localhost/~username/, you're actually being served files from that user's Sites directory within their home directory. But I don't want to talk about Mac OS X. I want to talk about the tilde. As with so many other things, I find that Jukka Korpela[1] is the expert in this field. Jukka is no doubt a member of my karass[2], a word which Google ( old habits die hard[3]) feels is best explained by the personal site of Eugene Wallingford, which, like Jukka's home page, can not be referenced without a tilde. In fact, Jukka has written a lengthy treatise on why the tilde should not be used in URLs[4], a treatise which, I feel obliged to point out, contains a tilde in its URL. Clearly, the tilde is underappreciated. Digging further, we find this post of Jukka's from 1998[5], in which we learn that the tilde was not meant to be the tilde at all, but rather an odd character called the overline. Presumably to balance out the underline, if indeed those sorts of things require balance. There is balance in the universe, to be sure, but I am less sure that it eminates from my keyboard. No matter. The tilde was the tilde so that Spanish-typing types could type the &ntilde; (now referenced in HTML as the named entity &ntilde;), but somewhere along the line, it morphed into a general-purpose character with all sorts of geeky uses. Digging even further, it appears that the tilde was originally an alternate for #[6], then an alternate for ^, and its life as an overline replacement came even later. Jukka confirms this[7] and adds a timeline: 1963 for #, 1964 for ^, 1966 for overline. Then June 30, 1966, the watershed moment in an X3 committee meeting, when it was proposed &#8220;as exclusively a tilde in USA to appease SHARE&#8221;. I can find no further reference as to what this acronym means, or what this committee meeting was about. The next reference isn't until 1991, when the tilde was officially added to ISO-646[8]. And now, down the rabbit hole we go. Scouring Usenet (which the kids of yesterday called &#8220;Deja News&#8221;, and kids today call &#8220;Google Groups&#8221;), we find a reprint of a 1991 William Safire (yes, _that_ William Safire) article On Language[9], in which we learn that ~ is officially pronounced &#8220;squiggle&#8221;. This is confirmed by the Jargon Dictionary [10] to this very day. I'm not sure this is useful, but I just thought it was cool to see William Safire writing about the proper pronunciation of various ASCII characters. As early as August 1990, tilde was included in the waka waka bang splat poem [11]. In July 1989, Kermit gained support for filenames containing a tilde[12]. In February 1988, an editor's note to an otherwise unrelated article notes that Fidonet supported ASCII characters space through tilde[13]. As early as January 1987, less used the tilde to denote lines past EOF[14]. As early as July 1986, troff supported the tilde[15]. In November 1985, a mod.sources post refers to Bourne shell enhancements (history,tilde,job control)[16]. As early as January 1984, tilde was included on the DEC keyboard[17] and listed in the APL-11 character set[18]. In April 1983, tilde was causing bugs in vi[19] (actually due to underlying bugs in csh). In December 1982, ~ is officially pronounced &#8220;tilde&#8221;[20], prompting this typographical pun[21]. And that's the earliest reference I can find. So where does that leave us? Unsatisfied, no doubt. There is history here, but there are gaps. What happened at that watershed meeting in 1966? How did the tilde rise to prominence in the 1980s? When did it become a synonym for &#8220;home directory&#8221;? When did it migrate into the world of web servers to provide a cheap and simple way of giving individual users their own web sites? I don't know, and the lateness of the hour prevents me from continuing my research, a failing for which I apologize profusely. Goodnight, goodnight. May you dream of tildes, stars, and whorls.

Exactly -- ""let's you and him fight"" is a way of dealing with troublesome populations by moving them next to one another, so they give each other, and not the Man, grief*. So by my understanding (and, you all will understand, with tongue firmly in cheek): Ireland: Irish? Uppity barbarians overly fond of ""risings"". Scots? More uppity barbarians overly fond of ""risings"". Why not plonk down a bunch of the latter next to the former and kill two birds with one stone? Israel: Ex-ottomans? Uppity barbarians (didn't they help kick out the Ottomans?) Zionists? Uppity sorts who aren't happy with perfectly good land in Uganda. Why not plonk down a bunch of the latter next to the former and kill two birds with one stone? but not: India: in which the muslims and hindus were originally intermixed to some degree, but Partioned due to their own conflict, not due to English resettlement policy. Canada: in which the french and english were already established, and it was just the balance of power on the continent that determined events in the colonies. The Acadians got resettled, but they don't seem to have been that good for picking fights with their neighbors, so no one had them plonked down next door. -Dave * this works best with a populace who, given ""one man, one vote"", immediately deduce ""one less man, one less vote"" -- eh, Magnan?",0

They were all getting married within a short time period. Because Mom was a bit worried about how their sex life would get started, she made them all promise to send a postcard from the honeymoon with a few words on how marital sex felt. The first girl sent a card from Hawaii two days after the wedding. The card said nothing but ""Maxwell House"". Mom was puzzled at first, but then went to the kitchen and got out the Nescafe jar. It said: ""Good till the last drop."" Mom blushed, but was pleased for her daughter. The second girl sent the card from Vermont a week after the wedding, and the card read: ""Benson & Hedges"". Mom now knew to go straight to her husband's cigarettes, and she read from the Benson & Hedges pack: ""Extra Long, King Size"". She was again slightly embarrassed but still happy for her daughter. The third girl left for her honeymoon in the Caribbean. Mom waited for a week, nothing. Another week went by and still nothing. Then after a whole month, a card finally arrived. Written on it with shaky handwriting were the words: ""British Airways"". Mom took out her latest Harper's Bazaar magazine, flipped through the pages fearing the worst, and finally found the ad for the airline. The ad said: ""Three times a day, seven days a week, both ways."" Mom fainted.",0

They can sit on /your/ copy, but if you start churning out exact dups of a name-brand artifact, people with law degrees start to smell money. For example, I could copy a Gibson Guitar /exactly/ so long as (a) I don't put Orville's name on the headstock and (b) I license the patented bracing methods. If I instead try to sell a homebuilt guitar on eBay with ""Gibson"" written in crayon on the headstock, and then claim it is a true Les Paul limited edition, I expect people would get upset.

To play the Devil's Advocate here, it's not about giving /stuff/ away, it is about granting endless and cascading duplication/distribution rights.

This is the difficult question: How will they draw the distinction? The ""other stuff"" is just as easy to duplicate as the free stuff. This is why MS is hunting people with illegal Windows; it's no harder to dup than a Linux CD, only what is there that actually prevents people from doing it? Personally, I don't think the issue should have anything to do with sales or units. The issue is that basic phallacy that says a suit should be able to ""own"" someone else's intellectual property. Sarah McLaughlin isn't suing you, it's her label's legal dept because it's the label who stands to lose; Sarah's already fat beyond her wildest dreams, so a few bucks here or there, or even if the well dried up tomorrow, it's not going to really traumatize her (unless she's been blazingly stupid with her money) But the label ... like Disney and Mickey, they need the cash cow so they can keep all sorts of uncreative hangers-on in limos and coke. If you thought only Elvis or Brian Jones or Dennis Wilson had problems with beautiful-people deadbeat leech ""friends"" draining their riches, think again. The problem is really very simple because it is semantic, and until we make the semantic flip, it's unsolvable, but like trisecting an angle, all it takes is looking at the same situation in a different way. Here's the revelation: Elvis never ever made a hit record. Elvis didn't make the hits, his /fans/ made the hits. His fans did the work cleaning toilets, manning the convenience stores, driving milk trucks, sitting at endless office desks, they did the /real/ labour that paid for every last one of Elvis Presley's pills. All Elvis did was sing into a microphone every so often, and pen or collect the odd song that all those /people/ liked and wanted as something of their own. But it's not _Elvis_ who made them universal statements, it is the universe of fans who slurped the songs into their own lives, it was pull-technology, not push. Therefore the question becomes: how many times must these fans pay before they own what they themselves have created? They pay royalties for listening to the radio, for blank tapes, for concert tickets, for a beer in a bar with a cover band ... they pay over and over and over again for the /right/ to make some hack writer's song /their/ favourite song???? That's where the whole system has been seriously warped by the record companies and ad companies reframing it into your thinking that it is the Elvis who makes the Elvis. It's not. It's the people who make them; the songs are already theirs. -- Gary Lawrence Murphy <garym@teledyn.com> TeleDynamics Communications Inc Business Advantage through Community Software : http://www.teledyn.com ""Computers are useless.

Tom <tomwhore@slack.net>,Keillor voices up on what to do with the WTC site,"http://www.phc.mpr.org/posthost/index.shtml Dear Garrison, There are at least six plans about what to do with ""Ground Zero"" in New York. I believe a suitable memorial surrounded by a lovely park with benches, walkways, children's playgrounds, possibly some concessions such as a restaurant, small theater and a place for art works would be the best tribute to those who lost their lives. What do you think should done with the space? Joe Adams Hillsdale, New Jersey I dread the thought of a big memorial in Manhattan that's designed by committee and that's gone through public hearings and so forth ----- it's going to be cold and ugly and pretentious and the upshot will be one more public space that the public hates, of which there are plenty already. New York is a bustling commercial city and that's the beauty of it, it's a city of young ambitious dreamy people, like the folks who died in the towers, and it's not a memorializing city. Historic events occurred in New York that in any other city would be commemorated with interpretive centers and guides and historical museums and in New York there's barely a little plaque. That's a great thing, in my estimation. It's a hustling city, full of immigrants looking for their big chance, and compared to that spirit of entrepreneurship, a memorial plaza with a fountain and a statue of something seems dead to me. Look at Grant's Tomb. Who walks past it and thinks about President Grant? Nobody. People sit in the plaza by Grant's Tomb and think about lunch, about sex, about money, about all the things that New York is about. If you want to find Grant, read his memoirs. His monument seems odd in New York: it belongs in Washington, which is our memorial city. New York is for the young and lively.",0
Martin Adamson <martin@srv0.ems.ed.ac.uk>,[zzzzteana] Scissors are a snip for Third World,"The Times September 06, 2002 Scissors are a snip for Third World From Richard Owen in Rome IT IS one of the unanswered questions of the past year: what happens to the millions of nail scissors confiscated by airport security officials from passengers hand luggage? Most are thrown away or recycled after being seized as part of security measures since September 11. But an enterprising chaplain is sending them to Catholic missionaries for distribution to Third World hospitals and clinics. In theory travellers who have left nail scissors, nail files, corkscrews or manicure sets from their hand luggage can arrange for them to be returned. In practice many just shrug and leave the scissors by the X-ray scanners. Father Arturo Rossini, chaplain of Malpensa airport in Milan, said that scissors were costly or unavailable in many parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America. He told Corriere della Sera that he had plucked up the courage to ask the authorities if he could have the confiscated scissors. With the help of a retired airport policeman, he had packaged 60,000 nail scissors and manicure sets, using the airport chapel as a packing centre. Packages were shipped in aircraft holds to Peru, Brasil, India, Mozambique, Argentina, Zambia and Kenya. In such countries, what we think of as a personal grooming accessory can be a vital tool. The idea has been taken up at other Italian airports. ------------------------ Yahoo!

I clocked my &#8220;long loop&#8221; today and discovered that the run I thought was 6 miles is actually only 5.6. And the &#8220;short loop&#8221; I thought was 5 miles is actually only 4.6. I have an off-by-0.4 bug. This is very upsetting. I've lost 0.4 miles somewhere. If anyone finds them, can you please let me know? Thank you. I ran 9 miles last week, and 10 so far this week, even taking into account my off-by-0.4 bug. I fear I am turning into a runner. My father and I made fun of runners when I was growing up. He used to say that you never saw a runner smiling. We'd drive by runners, point at them, and say, &#8220;Look, another runner... not smiling!&#8221; This weighed heavily on my psyche in my formative years. So it is with some measure of shame that I admit that I am becoming a runner. Becoming a runner is actually not that difficult. Not surprisingly, it involves running. There's other stuff, too, eventually, but running is the important part. If you can run a mile, run a mile. If you can only run around the block, run around the block. Tomorrow you'll run around the block, and the next day you'll find you can run around two blocks. And next week you'll find you can run a mile. Then one day you'll run a mile, then stop to catch your breath, then get invigorated and run another mile. And then you're a runner. That's it, really. It's not complicated. You run, and you run, and you run. And one day, you discover that shoes are important, and that the old sneakers you threw on the first time you tried out this running thing out aren't actually very good for running. So you go buy new shoes, and you run, and you run, and you run. And later, you discover that stretching is important too, so you stretch and run, and stretch and run, and stretch and run. There's other stuff too, but it doesn't really matter until you're already a runner. You learn about differences in running surfaces. And how many miles you should really put on one pair of shoes. And when in the day you should run to maximize calorie burning. And how to train for a marathon, and so forth. Don't worry about any of that now. Just run. Running is key.

Taking things further off-topic: Does Habeus charge a license fee to organizations who want to use their copyrighted material or is their sole revenue stream to come from legal judgements? On the one hand, if they charge license fees, I'd worry that when times got tough they'd be somewhat less critical of organizations we'd call spammers today in order to generate license fees. If not, I'd worry the pendulum would swing the other way and they'd go after legitimate businesses in an attempt to generate more revenues from judgements and/or out of court settlements.

Or even 300. Er, that study would seem to lend credence to Eugen's estimations, rather than casting fresh doubts. 52 a year *does* exceed 300, in under 6 years' time. The average age of that study's participants was *39* -- meaning some participants may have had 20-25+ years of active sex life. At that age, and further ** HIV+ **, it seems reasonable to think that some the participants may have actually slowed their pace a bit. So while this study's summary info is incomplete, you could easily conclude that the *average* participant in this one study will have had over a thousand partners over a 40-50+ year active sex life, and so the even-more-active tails of the distribution could easily be in the 3000+ range. Of course this says very little, almost nothing, about the overall population behavior, gay or straight, and the relative prevalence of 3K+ individuals in either group. But it does strongly suggest that gay males with 3K+ partners exist in measurable numbers, so people should stop treating Eugen's anecdotal estimation as if it were sheer fantasy.

Any CGI script, Java servlet, ASP component, etc. could be run on the client. This is like breaking the Web server into two parts. Originally, Web servers just understood HTTP and sent pages. Then the field started demanding more from the Web and the servers got loaded down with CGI and mod_perl and active pages and stuff. So now the Web server can choose to go back to simple serving and (where the application is appropriate) let the client do the other razzamatazz. This is superior to JavaScript in one important detail: the program doesn't have to reload when a new page is loaded, as JavaScript functions do. And because XDegrees uses Web-compatible technology, users can access XDegrees resources without installing any software, simply by using their browser."" === ""Scaling is the main question that comes to mind when somebody describes a new naming and searching system. CEO Michael Tanne claims to have figured out mathematically that the system can scale up to millions of users and billions of resources. Scaling is facilitated by the careful location of servers (XDegrees will colocate servers at key routing points, as Akamai does), and by directing clients to the nearest server as their default ""home"" server. Enterprise customers can use own servers to manage in-house applications."" ""Files can be cached on multiple systems randomly scattered around the Internet, as with Napster or Freenet. In fact, the caching in XDegrees is more sophisticated than it is on those systems: users with high bandwidth connections can download portions, or ""stripes,"" of a file from several cached locations simultaneously. The XDegrees software then reassembles these stripes into the whole file and uses digital signatures to verify that the downloaded file is the same as the original. A key component of this digital signature is a digest of the file, which is stored as an HTTP header for the file.""",0

Mario Torre <neugens@libero.it>,Encryption approach to secure web applications,"Hi everybody! I'm writing a web application in java (tomcat + jsp/servlets + database access with postgreSQL). This will be released under the GPL and will eventually be useful as a framework for other web applications. The application main focus is e-commerce, but not limited to that. I would like to use some form of cryptography to protect data on the database, but I have some problem figuring out the right approach. Above all, how to store passwords and keys in a shared web server. A problem that I was unable to solve is how to store keys for encryption/decryption. The api that I'm using is the jca (jdk1.4.x), and the methods of saving generated keys in keystores fails always. I can serialize the object, and store in the database, but this is not the most secure approach: this key is needed to decrypt data in the database, but the database is accessible from the web application. Assuming that I can find a good and secure place where to store the database password, I can use a different database with different user... Argh... to complex and doesn't really solve the problem. Where I can found good documentation about this topic? There is another approach that I would share with the list, something I thought that can be of bit interest, but probabily wrong and insecure. After all, I'm a real beginner in secure programming, and I'm here to learn methods and technics. First of all, I need a secure way to keep database passwords secure, so I have to keep them separate from the main server. The right approach could be using a small java bean application that run as normal user (not tomcat, so it is not shared with other web services or, worst, the nobody user), that has no shell login, but has a default home directory or a place where it can hold passwords and keys. The web application could then open an ssl connection (could be done in the init method at server startup) to get database passwords. The small bean could check via code signature/rmi/whatever else that the source is the right one, and handle all the database connections, or give the db connection/password to the main web application. In this way, we solve the problem of keeping the keys and passwords in shared directories, and also, an attacker should get root/bean user account to read data. This is not perfect, and works only if your provider gives the opportunity to configure a separated java application (that means, really, another server running in the background). Any suggestions?

They visited a lot of airshows and covered a lot of miles. I'm sure maintenance (on a 50+ year old airframe), fuel (for two large radial engines) insurance and other costs were out of my price range, but what a hoot! On a more realistic note, the flight to Half Moon bay was probably 2 hours of flight time at about $75/hour in the Cessna.

In late 1998, not two years out of college, he drew on his passion to co-found PayPal, the online payment system that has since attracted tens of millions of users and gained the reputation as the premier Internet transaction processor. Now online auction house eBay has acquired his company for a king's ransom. Not bad for a 27-year-old kid from Ukraine. A programmer since he was 10 years old, Levchin and his family moved to Chicago in 1991, and since then he has pursued security as if on a mission. He created a startup right out of college to build secure passwords for Palm Pilots. He met Peter Thiel, and the two founded PayPal to target online payment security. Thiel is now CEO of the company. ""This company was founded on the notion of security value,"" Levchin says. ""Peter Thiel and I shared that vision from the very beginning."" Thiel concentrates on company business matters, whereas Levchin remains focused on security, which he says is the key to the company's good fortune. ""I explain [PayPal] as a security company posing as a transaction processor,"" Levchin says. ""We spend a lot of time designing security so it doesn't step on the toes of convenience and not the other way around. The trade-off is fundamental."" Mountain View, Calif.-based PayPal allows businesses and consumers with e-mail addresses to send and receive payments via the Internet, accepting credit card or bank account payments for purchases. The service extends to 38 countries, with more than 17 million users and more than 3 million business accounts. Most of PayPal's users are participants in online auctions, which led PayPal to be closely linked with eBay, the leading Web auction site. Although they were once rivals, the relationship between the two companies resulted July 8 in eBay's tentative $1.5 billion acquisition of PayPal. The agreement is subject to regulatory review. Levchin says he will stay at PayPal as it merges with eBay. ""There are areas of synergy and collaboration we can explore."" Although security is a dominant feature for PayPal, the company's ability to carry out open communications among the millions of participants fits the growing Web services model, Levchin says. ""This is a service that links people and allows them to send messages to one another,"" he says. Levchin is a panelist at InfoWorld's Next-Generation Web Services II conference Sept. 20 PayPal, as an online payment system, is a natural target for fraud. And Levchin has almost singlehandedly saved the company from thieves bent on exploiting the system, says Avivah Litan, a vice president and analyst covering financial services at Stamford, Conn.-based Gartner. ""If they didn't have Max, they might have succumbed, because PayPal was susceptible to fraud and money laundering, and Max tightened them up,"" Litan says. To combat criminals, Levchin established ""Igor,"" an antifraud program that monitors transactions and warns of suspicious accounts. Levchin says building security and antifraud systems is a job he relishes. ""The work I do is important to PayPal and to consumers in general because the work makes Internet shopping safe. It's the view that ecommerce has arrived.""",0

So we could get a 50% decrease in size just by using the string representation instead of the pickle, right? Something about that logic seems wrong to me, but I can't see what it is. Maybe pickling is good for heterogeneous data types, but every value of our big dictionary is going to have the same type, so there's a ton of redundancy.

This is a pain. The only way you can resolve this, to my knowledge is to download the original libvorbis rpm and the new one. Remove the old one, then do: rpm -Uvh libvorbis-* RPM then assumes that you want both versions installed at the same time, and does so.

With is definitely easier.[1] Greg [1] http://www.endeavors.com/PressReleases/rsa.htm Endeavors Technology and RSA Security Form Strategic Partnership to Enhance SSL Performance in Secure, Enterprise-Scalable P2P Computing Endeavors Technology and RSA Security combine their respective peer-to-peer Magi Enterprise Web collaboration and RSA BSAFE® software for SSL users to instantly extend security and improve performance of desktop and corporate data sharing, and Web interaction between workgroups inside and across corporations. Irvine (CA) and Cambridge (UK), September 12, 2002 - Secure web collaboration software leader Endeavors Technology, Inc. today announced a technology sharing and marketing agreement with RSA Security Inc. the most trusted name in e-security.® This strategic partnership is aimed at extending the security and improving the performance of the standard SSL security protocol used by every e-based desktop, laptop and server. Under the terms of the agreement, RSA Security's trusted security tools are embedded into Endeavors Technology's award-winning Magi Enterprise software product. The combined solution enables IT managers and users to simply extend security and encryption to every Magi-enabled device for the direct device-to-device sharing and interaction of corporate data and workflow between workgroups within and beyond the enterprise. Secure collaboration between desktops and corporate systems calls for enterprises to build complex and costly network infrastructures. This combination of technologies from the two companies eliminates both overheads, and also the need for specific security tools for each desktop application such as Microsoft Project. With Magi's secure RSA Security-based peer environment, collaboration can now be rapidly, easily and securely extended across all devices and company firewalls, and workgroups can interact with colleagues, partners and clients without concern in compromising corporate information. This brings true Internet scaling to corporations needing to interact highly securely with strong encryption and authentication across firewalls. ""In these challenging times, there can be no compromise in safeguarding corporate data and knowledge,"" says Bernard Hulme, chairman and CEO of Endeavors Technology. ""Embedding RSA Security encryption software into Magi products provides IT managers with added assurance, speed and cost savings, and a proven security net to accelerate the deployment of business-centric peer-to-peer computing"" Endeavors Technology joins the RSA Secured® Partner Program. The program is designed to ensure complete interoperability between partner products and RSA Security's solutions including RSA SecurID® two-factor authentication, RSA ClearTrust® Web access management, RSA BSAFE® encryption and RSA Keon® digital certificate management. The strategic partnership paves the way for Magi Enterprise to bear the RSA Secured brand on product packaging and advertising, be listed in RSA Secured Partner Solutions directories, and have RSA Security's out-of-the-box, certified interoperability. It will also lead to joint marketing and promotional activities between the two firms, mutual field sales engagement opportunities on joint accounts, and 24x7 worldwide business continuity support. ""Endeavors Technology is taking a leadership role by providing the highest-level of security in its enterprise products and streamlining the deployment process for IT managers,"" says Stuart Cohen, director of partner development at RSA Security. ""By combining our products, enterprise customers have a solution that provides encryption and authentication across firewalls."" About Magi Magi Enterprise 3.0, an award-winning web collaboration system, transforms today's Web into a highly secure inter- and intra-enterprise collaboration network. For the first time, enterprises can implement ad-hoc Virtual Private Networks for collaboration very rapidly and affordably without disrupting existing applications, networks or work practices. Magi Enterprise 3.0 does this by effectively transforming unsecured, ""read-only"" Web networks into two-way trusted and transparent collaboration environments, through the use of such features as cross-firewall connections, advanced data extraction, an intuitive graphical interface, and universal name spaces generating ""follow me URLs"" for mobile professionals.

Not at all. There are still people who only have one partner. There are many more whoe only have one partner over ""long"" periods of time. So it is far from ""vacuous"" to describe some people as ""promiscuous"" and others as ""not promiscuous"", especially over a set period. (""He was promiscuous in college. He is no longer promiscuous."")

Then, 1 man, let's call him ""Wilt"", also has sex with the other 499,999 women. 499,999 women have had more than one partner. 499,999 men have only had one partner. It is now ""perfectly obvious"" that in the common meaning of the term, among this contrived population, that women are ""more promiscuous"" than men -- even though the single ""most promiscuous"" person, Wilt, is a man. ""Promiscuity"" is not ""exactly, perfectly identical between males and females"", except under a degenerate custom definition of ""promiscuity"". > >unless ""promiscuity"" is defined uselessly. > > Ain't nothin' useless about averages.

The ""From "" envelope is an artifact of the mbox mailbox format, and from that perspective it should be the mail server that stores its mailboxes in mbox format that should be responsible for escaping lines beginning with ""From "". On the other hand, this breaks the assumption that the mail transport only touches the message headers and leaves the message body alone. Things like pgp signatures break when the mail server changes the message body. Also, strictly speaking, the mbox format envelope (or for us old-timers, the UUCP envelope) isn't just any line beginning with ""From "".

For consultancy, integration or open source work, sure, perl, python or java with free use of external libs makes a lot of sense IMO. I should note that normally when I've used C or C++ in the past, it's dictated by the fact that I would be working on a commercial product, written from the ground up, where the code you're generating is important IP for the company; in this case, using a third-party lib often is not an option, or would be a PITA licensing-wise. Also, cutting out third-party dependencies can reduce the risk of ""oops, there goes the company that makes that library I depend on, now to shop around for something vaguely similar, figure out what bugs it's got, rewrite my code to use the new API, and hope for the best"".

Turkey City is a venerable science fiction workshop that has spawned many good writers and a lexicon of science fiction critical terms that is the de facto standard for understanding what works and what doesn't in a work of science fiction: Squid on the Mantelpiece Chekhov said that if there are dueling pistols over the mantelpiece in the first act, they should be fired in the third. In other words, a plot element should be deployed in a timely fashion and with proper dramatic emphasis. However, in SF plotting the MacGuffins are often so overwhelming that they cause conventional plot structures to collapse. It's hard to properly dramatize, say, the domestic effects of Dad's bank overdraft when a giant writhing kraken is levelling the city. This mismatch between the conventional dramatic proprieties and SF's extreme, grotesque, or visionary thematics is known as the ""squid on the mantelpiece."" Card Tricks in the Dark Elaborately contrived plot which arrives at (a) the punchline of a private joke no reader will get or (b) the display of some bit of learned trivia relevant only to the author. This stunt may be intensely ingenious, and very gratifying to the author, but it serves no visible fictional purpose. (Attr.

"""Mr. FoRK"" <fork_list@hotmail.com>",Sun Nabs Storage Startup - buys Pirus Networks,"Related to the MS acquisition of XDegrees? == http://www.internetnews.com/infra/article.php/1466271 Sun Nabs Storage Startup By Clint Boulton Amid the flurry of news at its own SunNetwork 2002 conference in San Francisco, Sun Microsystems Thursday said it has agreed to purchase data storage concern Pirus Networks for an undisclosed amount of stock. The Palo Alto, Calif. networking firm bought the Acton, Mass.-based startup with a keen eye for the startup's switching (define) devices and virtualization technology. Used as part of a storage area network (define), virtualization is the pooling of storage from many network storage devices into what appears to the operating system to be a single storage device that is managed from a central console. Though major vendors make similar technology, Pirus competes with the likes of Rhapsody Networks and Confluence Networks. Sun plucked Pirus after scouting some 65 companies. Mark Lovington, vice president of marketing for Pirus, told internetnews.com that Pirus and Sun have been in discussion for a while about a possible acquisition. Pirus, he said, succeeded in a goal it shares with a lot of storage startups -- to be acquired by one of the major systems vendors, such as Sun IBM, HP, Hitachi. ""This is a huge opportunity for Pirus in a storage market dominated by 6,7 or 8 system-level players,"" Lovington said. ""Sun sees this acquisition as a critical element to their N1 initiative. The synergies were quite obvious."" N1 is Sun's hopeful tour de force in distributed computing (define) architecture, which involves multiple, remote computers that each have a role in a computation problem or information processing. N1 is being styled as the answer for companies looking to manage groups of computers and networks as a single system -- at a lower cost and with greater flexibility. While lagging behind other, more entrenched players, Sun is gaining ground in the storage market with its Sun StorEdge Complete Storage Solutions, according to a new report by IDC. John McArthur, group vice president of IDC's Storage program, said Sun Microsystems and IBM posted the largest increases in total storage revenue over Q1 2002, with 32% and 11% gains, respectively. As of Q2, Sun held a 9 percent market share, with revenues of $411 million. Sun's acquisition of Pirus is expected to close in the second quarter of Sun's 2003 fiscal year, which ends December 29, 2002.",0

Rolf Eden, 72, a Berlin disco owner famous for his countless sex partners, said he could imagine no better way to die than in the arms of an attractive young woman - preferably under 30.

This 'steel-effect' might give bone structure and tendons dramatically (several orders of magnitude) more tensile strength without the need to significantly increase the weight (like magnesium-alloy or carbon-fiber weight compared to iron, Spidey could even be way under weight). Only increasing tensile strength could accommodate the mobility and leverage feats since bones are actually formed from bubbles of organic material hydrolically assisted, tensile strength cross-sectionally would give his frame the strength to withstand the muscular enhancement.

If the same close-packing gap-filling arachne-molecular structure modification occurs in neural tissues, and there'd be no reason to think that these would grow differently from bones and tendons, then what we are seeing in spidey sense is no more than the heightened cerebral functions due to shorter/faster/stronger synapses throughout the entire nervous system. Since we know dogs and cats measure human emotions by smell, clearly hearing the heartbeats, and other subtle clues within their normal sensory ranges (but seem mystical to us) ... for Peter Parker, everything from air currents on his facial-hairs to extremely subtle hormone smells might coallesce into a general gestalt of Spidey-Sense; don't forget that he'd acquired this ability in adolescence and thus would lack any cultural or even pathological basis to explain the heightened awareness to himself in anything but mystical terms. We know from issue #1 that his collision-avoidance reflex response time was far swifter than his cognitive awareness since he 'found' himself already stuck to the tree when the bicycle was already past and hence his disorientation (""You ok, Mister?"") as if it was a hallucination. Hmmm ... it may even be physio-psychologically interesting to examine if Peter Parker's personal quandries arose _because_ his physiological 'Spidey' infrastructure had been advanced whereas his psychological perception of his self had not, ie, ""Peter"" was not ""Spiderman"" but just the ""driver of the bus"".

(When it was apparent that TCP networks were useful, berkeley sockets could be found even on VMS and Win 3.1 boxen) Why would early Unix have run with the idea that, if one wishes to do multiple things at the same time, one can use a group of processes to do them? - they had Multics as a counterexample? - in the days of tiny memories and tapes, people were more accustomed to writing programs that didn't run entirely in a single address space? - one is a great number for an interface, as log(1) is 0, and specification can be implicit? - some combination of the above? Now, as Hoare says: > There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make > it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other is to > make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. As programmers, we've been able to make our lives complicated for at least half a century; the hardware interrupt gives us the rope. Part of Dijkstra's inspiration for THE was the counterexample of IBM's multi- programmed boxes (were these the same ones that inspired Mythical Man Month?) and I suppose he would say the question is how not to make a mess of it -- how should we structure computations so if we try to do ten times as many things at the same time, reasoning about the resulting system is at most ten times more complex -- not one hundred, and certainly not three and a half million times more. Compared to that project, the prospect of writing a driver library for various vendors' aio implementations seems to be truly trivial. -Dave (Oracle, in their quest for portability, used to use raw disks for the database.

But that obscures the different modes of promiscuity. Both the person who gives sex for money or power or companionship and the person who uses money and power and companionship to get sex are promiscuous, in the broadest sense of the word. But their motives and behavior are quite different. Langur monkeys were the example in the cited article. ""Dominant males .. kill babies that are not their own."" ""The dominant male monkey .. seeks to defend his harem of females."" But cozying up to the current dominant male isn't the best strategy for female langurs, because ""dominant males are dethroned by rivals every 27 months or so."" ""By mating with as many extra-group males as possible, female langurs ensure their offspring against infanticide,"" by the male who is likely next to rule the roost. Maybe it's just me, but that doesn't paint a picture of carefree females engaged in joyously promiscuous couplings.

I havent used the FBSD poll, as it's not portable, select and poll(still not 100%) are all that exist in the UNIX world. Redhat of course doesnt count as portable either, but it's nice they are trying. The Windows I/O model does definately blow the doors off the UNIX one, but then they had select to point at in it's suckiness and anything would have been an improvement. UNIX is just now looking at it's I/O model and adapting to a multiprocess multithreaded world so it's gonna be years yet before a posix API comes out of it.

I have setup two MX records (mail and bmail) for my mail server.

As I understand it, DNS A records are used in a rotating fashion for load balancing, but DNS MX records are used in order or prority, meaning the 10 before the 20 and only 20 if the 10 isn't available. But only some of the mail is actually being scanned which leads me to believe that not all of the mail is actually hitting that box and the 10 never goes down. Why?

Ananova: Giant horse images 'defaced by hunting activists' Pro-hunt activists have defaced two of the country's national monuments - the two giant white horses - to highlight their cause. Campaigners for the Real Countryside Alliance say they targeted the two images, on hills in Oxfordshire and North Yorkshire, ""to keep the pro-hunt thing in the papers"". Aerial shots show the 374ft-long Bronze Age image on the Berkshire Downs near Uffington in Oxfordshire complete with three white hounds and a rider. In North Yorkshire, a rider in full hunt regalia has been added to the 300ft White Horse cut in to the hills at Kilburn, which dates back to the 1700s. But no-one reported anything to the police. A spokesman for North Yorkshire police said no reports had been received but he had seen ""a red blob"" on the horse and had sent officers to investigate. In Uffington, no-one in the village had heard anything about the reported incident. A spokesman for Thames Valley police said he was not aware of any complaints. Activists say the image in Oxfordshire was drawn in paint used for marking lines on grass tennis courts and will wash away in the first rains.

I simply put it (them) into my (nmh) component files (components, replcomps, forwcomps and so on). That way you get them when you are editing your message.

The problem comes with the record keeping they mandate with webstreaming. Start and end times for every song (not too hard), artist (okay), title (okay), composers (a little harder), serial number (wtf??). I think there are a few more things they wanted, but honestly, programming this info in for every song that we play is ridiculous. This means we'd also have to get all the DJs to find this info and write it down any time they play a request, vinyl, or CDs not loaded into the computer. It's ridiculous and nearly impossible... We would need someone to sit in the studio 24/7 writing down all this info - which sometimes isn't available, like from earlier album that don't have serial numbers and barcodes. Then still if only the magic 18 people webstream our signal, the price would become quite exponential since we play on average 16 songs an hour, we'd be paying $22.11 everyday to stream to those 18 people.

Martin Adamson <martin@srv0.ems.ed.ac.uk>,[zzzzteana] Emigrate to Russia? That's a steppe too far,"The Electronic Telegraph Emigrate to Russia? That's a steppe too far (Filed: 28/08/2002) So you think you've got it bad: fed up with Folkestone, bored with Birmingham or sick of Sheffield. Those 54 per cent of Britons - according to a Daily Telegraph/YouGov survey this week - who dream of a stress-free life in sunnier climes should perhaps heed a word of friendly advice on the realities of living abroad. Kommersant, a Russian daily newspaper, yesterday offered those dissatisfied with life in Blair's Britain a taste of what to expect should they choose to emigrate to provincial Russia. After reading about the gripes of affluent Britons, its tongue-in-cheek article admitted, however, that the grass was not always greener on the other side. ""The inhabitants of foggy Albion keen to travel could go to any Russian city deep in the provinces where things are quiet,"" said Kommersant. ""In any central Russian district, life, by British standards, is unseemingly cheap and remarkably laid back. By 11am most of the working population are becoming 'traditionally' relaxed."" The time for elevenses in Britain - perhaps the opportunity for a quiet cup of tea and a chocolate Hobnob - is known in Russia as the Wolf Hour. It was so named in Soviet times because at 11am a wolf appeared from the famous animal clock at the Obrasov Puppet Theatre in Moscow. It is also opening time in the nation's vodka shops. And the vodka, like all other spirits, is cheap. Kommersant pointed out that ""the money a Briton can earn from selling even the most shabby house would be enough to support them at the local standard of living for the rest of their life. ""The local shops are full of all they would need and they could buy a bottle of whisky for kopecks."" There are 100 kopecks in a ruble and the ruble is currently worth about a halfpenny in sterling. The whisky is cheap, however, because it is unlike anything the average Briton will have consumed before. It is made of samagon - home-distilled, moonshine vodka - coloured with tea, and is a popular beverage in rural areas and among diehard alcoholics. While alcohol is plentiful and cheap, food may not be so easy to come by. The newspaper pointed out that traditional British foodstuffs - it selected oxtail soup as an example - were in short supply. However, the wealth of the British settler should overcome the difficulty. ""For a modest reward in most Russian villages, the locals would happily cut off the tails from the entire collective farm's herd of cattle."" One or two potential emigrés might be deterred by language difficulties. There are few English speakers to be found among the green hills of Tula on the Mongolian border. However, Kommersant pointed out, language difficulties were not considered a deterrent by the 13 per cent of Britons who nominated France as the country in which they would like to live. France, the Russian paper claimed, was a country ""where English is only known by the beggars, Belorussian prostitutes and Russian tourists"". Despite the low cost of living and the easy-going lifestyle, the Russian weather remains a major stumbling block for Britons. Even in the most temperate regions, winter temperatures of -20C are common. And somewhere like the Sakha Republic - east of Siberia and the coldest place in the world - enjoys just one month of summer and endures winter temperatures that drop below -70C. Houses are built on concrete stilts because the permafrost makes digging foundations impossible. Again, the Russian paper had a word of reassurance. While acknowledging the climatic problems, it said that ""thanks to global warming this difficulty will solve itself"". Kommersant also had an answer to the labour crisis that would be created in Britain if 54 per cent of its citizens decided to opt for a life in Russia. ""Thirty-three million Russians could be sent to Britain to replace the 33 million who leave. We think that the required number could probably be found amongst our citizens."" Unfortunately for those 33 million Russians, however, not one of those Britons surveyed who wanted to move abroad nominated the Russian steppes as their preferred new home. ------------------------ Yahoo!

Still, definately something not right about the below. People are now cheaper then a decent laptop? (ok, so we knew that already) ------------- Selling Wedded Bliss Big Business in Thailand Thu Aug 29,10:19 AM ET By Andrew Marshall BANGKOK, Thailand (Reuters) - English dentist Ken Moylan came to Thailand looking for a wife. It took two hours to find her. ""The first day I went out with Wan, she came back to my hotel and hung all my clothes up and tidied the room. I thought it was marvelous,"" he said. ""I knew then there was something special."" Moylan, 49, is one of thousands of men who use introduction agencies to meet -- and marry -- Thai women. He lives in England now with 28-year-old Wan, who is expecting their first child. Critics of marriage agencies say they exploit the grinding poverty of women in developing countries, offering dreams of a new life in the West that often turn sour. But Moylan says he has no regrets about coming to Thailand in search of a wife. ""I got to Thailand at 2 p.m., and by 4 p.m. I'd met Wan,"" he said. ""I knew I found her attractive. I could tell straight away that she was very caring."" Moylan spent a week in Thailand, and after returning to England kept in touch with Wan by phone and mail. Six months later she came to England and the couple married. MR. MARRIAGE Lawrence Lynch, 49, runs Thai Professional Introduction Services, the agency Moylan used to meet his wife. Lynch, who calls himself ""Mr. Marriage,"" started the company after also marrying a Thai woman through an introduction agency. Since then he has helped set up hundreds of marriages. ""In the last five years we've done about 400,"" he said. ""To the best of my knowledge, they have all been successful."" Male clients pay $2,213 for the service, although men from countries that require them to handle some of the visa work on their own get a discount. Clients then get to view catalogs and videos of hundreds of Thai women looking for a husband. If they like what they see they come to Bangkok. Clients are introduced to several women in chaperoned meetings in Lynch's office -- encounters that can often be awkward given mutual shyness and language problems. ""We find that the gentlemen are usually just as nervous as the ladies,"" Lynch said. ""But once they start meeting the ladies they soon relax."" After the first meeting, couples can decide to go on dates to get to know each other better. Within two weeks of arrival, Lynch says, almost every client has found a potential wife. ""At the end of a fortnight it's very, very rare for a guy to go back and think he hasn't made his mind up,"" he said. In most cases, marriage follows, usually within the next year. Roongthip Kamchat, managing director of Thai No. 1 Connections, a Bangkok-based agency, says she has introduced about 1,000 couples, and less than 10 percent have broken up. Roongthip says she sometimes has a difficult time calming men who have just arrived in Bangkok looking for a wife. ""Sometimes they are very nervous,"" she said. ""And sometimes they are very impatient and say 'Give me a lady, I want to get married now.' I say: 'Calm down, OK, we'll talk.""' But if men are really in a hurry, Roongthip says, she can find them a wife and get them married within a week. Lynch says clients he has found wives for include a blind man, a man with one leg and a man with post-traumatic stress disorder. WHY? Similar marriage agencies can be found in many developing countries. Critics say they thrive on the neediness of lonely Western men who are unable to form relationships in their own country, and on the desperation of impoverished women who believe they can find a better life in the West. But Moylan says that if the arrangement makes both partners happy, there is no reason to object. ""If you talk about people who are needy, I think everybody wants someone to love them, and wants someone to love, so yes, I need Wan,"" he said. ""Thai women are dissatisfied with life in Thailand. I think there's no secret there. They are looking for a better life. I don't have a problem with that. In return they are willing to give a lot of love and care to their future husband."" Lynch says men are dissatisfied with Western women too, and that is why they choose to use his agency. His brochure promises an alternative to the ""kind of de-feminized, over-sized, self-centered, mercenary-minded lady available on the British singles scene,"" and says he can make dreams come true even for men who are not ""God's gift to women."" Roongthip said many Western men found it difficult to meet women in their own countries -- and found Thai women attractive. ""They don't know how to meet women. Even if they go to pubs or discotheques or restaurants or department stores, how can they ask people to marry them? Impossible,"" she said. ""Many Thai girls are slim, have long hair, black eyes, small nose. They are good at taking care and joking and laughing, not strict. Different from ladies from other countries."" Although many couples married through agencies have a considerable age gap, the agencies say this is not a problem. They say language problems are also not a major obstacle. ""Thai ladies are not ageist, and they have no qualms whatsoever about having a husband who is significantly older,"" Lynch said. ""When I met my wife she couldn't speak a word of English. We muddled along with a phonetic dictionary. The ladies are very keen to learn English and they pick it up very quickly."" Many agencies also offer tuition for woman on what to expect when they move to the West. ""We have kitchens, we have study classes,"" Roongthip said. ""We teach them how to eat, and when to make tea."" PITFALLS But not all dreams come true. ""Bee"" is a 26-year-old Thai woman who went to Switzerland two years ago with a man she met through an agency. Now she is back in Bangkok, sad and angry. ""He had no friends, and I was so lonely,"" she said. ""I tried to make him happy but he just wanted sex and somebody to keep his house clean. He never spoke to me."" Bee came back to Bangkok earlier this year. ""I thought I would be happy there,"" she said. ""But it was the worst time of my life."" Lynch says that while some agencies are badly run, he makes checks to ensure unsuitable candidates are weeded out. ""We are ethical and professional,"" he said. ""We will not take on all comers."" Moylan says that despite possible pitfalls, his own marriage is proof the arrangement can work. Wan's sister has just signed up with Lynch's company, looking for a foreign husband. ""Perhaps there are cases of women being exploited. I'm sure there are,"" Moylan said. ""But in the majority of cases the women get a good deal.""",0

First, I went seven minutes on the treadmill. That was pretty good. My heart was racing like it hadn't since I was in college. They also did an extensive ultrasound on my carotid arteries[1], they're in the neck and supply my head with blood. More good news there. They're clear, free of plaque, healthy, not diseased[2]. So it appears I just have coronary artery disease, not general artery disease. That's good because there would be a risk of stroke if they were sick, and not a whole lot they can do about it (as they can with the heart). Now there was some not-good news. A small part of my heart isn't working very well. There are a few possible reasons for that, some fixable, some not. I asked the doctor, does this mean I'm going to die sooner, and he said no. Does it mean I have to restrict what I do, he said no. So what does it mean? Really not much, other than I should watch, as before, for recurring symptoms, the ones that brought me into the hospital in June. If they come back, we'll do an angiogram, and maybe an angioplasty, but the likelihood of another bypass because of this is small. That's quite a relief. I don't like the idea of part of my heart not working, but what can you do about it?

Andy <andy@r2-dvd.org>,[zzzzteana] Betamax finally laid to rest,"Not fortean, but a moment in time all the same... http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/2220972.stm Betamax video recorders are finally being phased out almost 20 years after losing the battle for dominance of the home video market to VHS. Betamax's manufacturer, Sony, has announced that it will make only 2,000 more machines for the Japanese market. They have not been on sale in the rest of the world since 1998. VHS became the dominant format by the mid-1980s Betamax was launched in 1975, and won many fans who said it was better quality than its VHS rival. Some 2.3 million Betamax machines were sold worldwide in its peak year, 1984, but it soon went downhill as VHS became the format of choice for the film rental industry and in homes. Just 2,800 machines were sold in the 12 months to March 2002. ""With digital machines and other new recording formats taking hold in the market, demand has continued to decline and it has become difficult to secure parts,"" Sony said in a statement. Sony said it would continue to offer repairs and manufacture tapes for the format. The professional Betamax format, Betacam, is still widely used in the television and film industries and will be unaffected. But the recent rise of DVDs seems to have put the final nail in the coffin for Betamax home players. In the 1980s, many video rental chains preferred the VHS format. Betamax lovers became so passionate about the format in the face of competition from VHS that they set up the Betaphile Club in 1988. The picture and sound quality of Beta was superior to VHS, Betaphiles say, although VHS tapes had a longer duration. A total of 18 million Betamax machines were sold around the world, but no new ones will be made after the end of 2002. Sony is now planning to focus its efforts on new digital technologies.

Don't worry too much about it, you seem to have plenty of other things to do in the immediate future, and this one isn't so critical that people can't use the code in normal ways. But, to make it happen, type (with normal key bindings) any digit, so the code thinks you're trying a message number, then backspace, so the digit goes away, then '-' (other junk characters don't seem to have the problem, I have just been playing). That will do it (every time). That is: 0 ^h - Once you get into that state, the same traceback occurs for every character you type, until a message is selected with the mouse.

Hennessy has published a proof-of-concept showing the latest version of Trillian, v0.73, is vulnerable to a buffer-overflow attack that will allow individuals with malicious intent to run any program on the computer. Trillion is a piece of software that allows you to connect to ICQ, AOL Instant Messenger, MSN Messenger, Yahoo! Messenger and IRC with a single interface, despite some companies actively avoiding messenger interoperability. According to Jason Ross, senior analyst at amr interactive, in June 2002 there were 28,000 home users of Trillian in Australia, about 0.4 percent of the Internet population, and 55,000 people using it at work, about 1.8 percent of the Internet population. David Banes, regional manager of Symantec security response, told ZDNet Australia the code appeared to be valid. ""With these sort of things you have to find some process that would accept a connection, then throw loads of random data at it and get it to crash,"" he said. ""Once it's crashed, you can try to find a way to exploit it."" He said the proof-of-concept that was published is designed to run on Notepad, but could be easily modified to run any program on the system. He said the problem was easy to fix by ""writing protective code around that particular piece to more closely validate the data around that piece."" ""Because people are pushed for productivity you tend to leave out the checks and balances you should put in, which is why we have all these buffer overflows and exploits out there now,"" said Banes. Cerulean Studios, creator of Trillian, was contacted for comment but had not responded by the time of publication. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ For all security-related news, including updates on the latest viruses, hacking exploits and patches, check out ZDNet UK's Security News Section.

Waider <waider@waider.ie>,[ILUG] serial port transient failure,"Here's a weird and wacky problem: I'm currently out of the country with my trusty Evo N600c laptop. When I tried to use the serial port to talk to my mobile phone, Linux behaved pretty much as if the port was fried. Bizarre, I thought, because I'd used it successfully while in the office. The only difference was that I was trying the thing in the hotel. I entertained brief notions of having somehow fried the serial drivers, then rebooted the laptop to Windows and tried again. Worked perfectly. Back to Linux. Still not talking. Considered that it might be flaky power, so I ran the laptop on battery. Nope. Tried moving the laptop to a differnet part of the room where there might be less bogon flux. Still not working. Eventually I gave up and used the IrDA port instead - which is usually the serial connection of doom, grief, and teeth-grinding. This morning, in the office, the damn thing is working without a hitch. Anyone like to suggest what mystery technology is in use in the hotel that prevents serial ports from working under Linux?

Martin Adamson <martin@srv0.ems.ed.ac.uk>,[zzzzteana] Six arrested for attacking Palio jockey who defected,"The Electronic Telegraph Six arrested for attacking Palio jockey who defected By Bruce Johnston in Rome (Filed: 28/08/2002) Police waded into the intrigues and enmities surrounding the Palio, Siena's traditional bareback horse race, for the first time yesterday, arresting six people for beating up a star jockey who defected to a rival team. Angry spectators attack Giuseppe Pes at the Palio horse race in Siena Giuseppe Pes, a champion jockey of Sardinian extraction who has won the Palio nine times in 38 runs, was closely associated with the Istrice, or Porcupine, contrada - section of town - until the race earlier this month. Istrice did not have a horse in the contest - only 10 of the 17 contradas take part in each Palio - but, despite promises to the contrary, moments before the off Mr Pes mounted the horse of Lupa, or She-Wolf. Lupa are Istrice's historic rivals, and the defection was not taken well. Lupa did not win, victory going instead to Tartuca, tortoise. As its supporters erupted into joyous celebrations, Mr Pes was pulled from his mount by Istrice members and savagely beaten and kicked for seven minutes. Mr Pes, 39, whose jacket with his contrada's colours was torn from his back, was sent to hospital with fractures, cuts and bruises. Three of his attendants who tried to intervene were also beaten. Police yesterday arrested six people they said had been identified as the attackers from video footage. Experts said it was the first time that members of a contrada - known as contradaioli - had been arrested for beating up a jockey, despite the fact that such episodes belong to the race's ancient traditions. The Palio, which was first raced in the 14th century, is held twice a year on the cobbles of Siena's main square. For weeks beforehand supporters parade through the city, singing, waving flags and wearing their contrada colours. But by the day of the race the good humour evaporates. The event has no rules and is prepared for and run amid an extraordinary undercurrent of intrigue and even violence. Jockeys may swap sides at the last minute, take bribes, and whip rivals' horses, and more, so long as they do not grab their reins. The origins of the contrada lie in the Middle Ages, when the neighbourhoods' boundaries were set out to aid the many mercenary companies hired to defend Siena's fiercely earned independence from Florence and other city states. The first Palio of the year takes place on July 2, to commemorate the miracles of the Madonna of Provenzano, and a second race on Aug 16 marks the feast of the Assumption of the Virgin. ------------------------ Yahoo!

"""hyatt@mozilla"" <rssfeeds@example.com>",Validation,"URL: http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/#85395270 Date: Not supplied I feel so tremendously validated right now in all my criticisms of Netscape vs. Mozilla. I told Netscape management that if the Netscape beta shipped without popup blocking that CNet would write an article on it. They didn't believe me (or didn't care). Sure enough, the article appeared right on time[1]. I blogged about two main annoyances when installing Netscape 7: the lack of popup blocking and all of the annoying advertising spam on the desktop and in the toolbars. I warned Netscape that they needed to take steps to correct this problem. They didn't listen. Take a look at the CNet review[2] highlight that describes *The Bad* part of Netscape 7.0: _Displays AOL ads everywhere; doesn't let you turn off pop-up windows like Mozilla does; devours 30MB of disk space._ Plenty of other engineers at Netscape (as well as managers) complained about these problems and fought with those higher up to correct these problems. We lost every battle. The simple truth is that the people in charge of running the Netscape browser are incompetent. They don't understand how to make a good browser, or they don't care. Their engineers tell them what they're doing wrong, and they don't listen. Maybe you'll listen to the public. How about eWeek's article, Netscape 7.0 Shrivels Under Mozilla's Shadow[3]? Are you paying attention now, you ignorant, stupid, incompetent buffoons? ""I told you so."" never felt so good. Maybe they will sit up and take notice now. If they do, well, it's about fucking time.

Tim Chapman <timc@2ubh.com>,[zzzzteana] Dracula theme park could be switched to Bucharest,"Ananova: Dracula theme park could be switched to Bucharest A controversial scheme to build a Dracula theme park in Romania could be switched away from Transylvania. Consultants PricewaterhouseCoopers is now recommending that it be built in Bucharest instead. It comes after Prince Charles led international protests against the original proposals to build it in the medieval town of Sigishoara. PricewaterhouseCoopers name Bucharest, originally believed to be an outsider in the race to host the park, as the most profitable location for the project. But that has angered residents in Sigishoara, where Vlad the Impaler, the inspiration for Dracula, was born. They are counting on the park to boost the local economy. Evenimentul Zilei reports that Sigishoara was placed behind the capital with the Black Sea port of Constanta third choice. Dorin Danesan, mayor of Sigishoara, said: ""The pre-feasibility report from PWC shows that the park would attract more tourists if it was located in Bucharest. But I still think that Sigishoara is the best location for it."" The park would include hotels, a Dracula roller coaster, catacombs, a ghost train and a house of horrors, as well as vampire dungeons located around a reconstruction of Dracula's castle and an artificial lake. The project has also been objected to by the world heritage organisation Unesco fearing Sigishoara might be spoilt. PricewaterhouseCoopers is to present its final report on the project on October 15.

Recently, in private email, Ernest Miller claimed that doing so would be a violation of the DMCA. In this in-depth special report, I show that using perfectly legal, (I assume) licensed, off-the-shelf consumer software, copying DVDs is easy and in many ways encouraged. *Tools:* 1 PowerBook G4 with slot-loading DVD drive (any model should work) 1 Monsters, Inc. Collector's Edition DVD (any DVD should work) 1 copy of Mac OS X 10.2 ""Jaguar"" *Process:* 1. Insert DVD into drive. Notice how Jaguar helpfully loads the DVD Player for you. 2. Open the DVD (it appears on the desktop) and drag the VIDEO_TS folder to your hard drive. Ejct the DVD. 3. In DVD Player, select ""Open VIDEO_TS Folder..."" from the File menu. Use the dialog that appears to select the VIDEO_TS folder on your hard drive. Now the DVD plays just like it would were the DVD in the drive. By extension, I could also put the DVD up on my site for you to download and watch. I could share it via a P2P network. And I haven't done anything to decrypt the DVD or violate the DMCA: I've used only basic tools available to all normal computer users on my (I assume) fully-licensed consumer laptop. *Disclaimer:* Seth Schoen, whose opinion I highly respect on these matters, finds it unlikely that the DVD was CSS-encrypted if this was possible. I am not sure how to verify if the DVD is CSS-encrypted. If someone has a suggestion, please let me know.

boingboing <rssfeeds@example.com>,Record industry defends practices to Senate,"URL: http://boingboing.net/#85513221 Date: Not supplied The Joint Hearing of the Senate Committee and Senate Select Committee on the Entertainment Industry is underway in LA, investigating artists' claims that the labels engage in unfair and corrupt business-practices. The first day's findings at the hearings are really quite remarkable: By contract, artists are prohibited from showing royalty statements to third parties. Normally this would not include their mangers, lawyers, consultants, or others who could aid them in getting paid, but apparently this is not necessarily the case. Senator Kevin Murray, leading the initiative for artists' rights, claimed the that Cary Sherman, Chief Counsel for the RIAA himself, said to him in an interview, that RIAA members (the major labels) would sue any artist that broke ranks and shared information with the Committee. This claim was rejected by Sherman but supported by others in the room. Don Henley, among them, outwardly dared his record company to sue him for bringing royalty statements to the hearing. He presented his most recent royalty statement for ""Hell Freezes Over,"" which showed the panel that even though his contract called for a no more than a 10% ""reserve"" on sales of records shipped, Universal Music had held back more than that for eleven pay periods (roughly under three years) and that, even though his contract calls for no free goods in Europe, they had deducted $87,000 in free goods charges to Europe.

Actually, if I remember correctly from discussion of the list's composition in Forbes about five or six years ago, the *best* way to get on the Forbes 400 is to have *no* college at all. Can you say ""Bootstraps"", boys and girls? I knew you could... [Given that an undergraduate liberal arts degree from a state school, like, say, mine, :-), is nothing but stuff they should have taught you in a government-run ""high"" school, you'll probably get more of *those* on the Forbes 400 as well as time goes on. If we ever get around to having a good old fashioned government-collapsing transfer-payment depression (an economic version of this summer's government-forest conflagration, caused by the same kind of innumeracy that not clear-cutting enough forests did out west this summer :-)) that should motivate more than a few erst-slackers out there, including me, :-), to learn to actually feed themselves.] The *next* category on the Forbes 400 list is someone with a ""terminal"" professional degree, like an MBA, PhD, MD, etc., from the best school possible. Why? Because, as of about 1950, the *best* way to get into Harvard, for instance, is to be *smart*, not rich. Don't take my word for it, ask their admissions office. Look at the admissions stats over the years for proof. Meritocracy, American Style, was *invented* at the Ivy League after World War II. Even Stanford got the hint, :-), and, of course, Chicago taught them all how, right? :-). Practically *nobody* who goes to a top-20 American institution of higher learning can actually afford to go there these days. Unless, of course, their parents, who couldn't afford to go there themselves, got terminal degrees in the last 40 years or so. And their kids *still* had to get the grades, and ""biased"" (by intelligence :-)), test scores, to get in. The bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with ""terminal"" degrees, until they actually *own* something and *hire* people, or learn to *make* something for a living all day on a profit and loss basis, persist in the practically insane belief, like life after death, that economics is some kind of zero sum game, that dumb people who don't work hard for it make all the money, and, if someone *is* smart, works hard, and is rich, then they stole their wealth somehow. BTW, none of you guys out there holding the short end of this rhetorical stick can blame *me* for the fact that I'm using it to beat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders. You were, apparently, too dumb to grab the right end. *I* went to Missouri, and *I* don't have a degree in anything actually useful, much less a ""terminal"" one, which means *I*'m broker than anyone on this list -- it's just that *you*, of all people, lots with educations far surpassing my own, should just plain know better. The facts speak for themselves, if you just open your eyes and *look*. There are no epicycles, the universe does not orbit the earth, and economics is not a zero-sum game. The cost of anything, including ignorance and destitution, is the forgone alternative, in this case, intelligence and effort. [I will, however, admit to being educated *waay* past my level of competence, and, by the way *you* discuss economics, so have you, apparently.] BTW, if we ever actually *had* free markets in this country, *including* the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes, all those smart people in the Forbes 400 would have *more* money, and there would be *more* self-made people on that list. In addition, most of the people who *inherited* money on the list would have *much* less of it, not even relatively speaking. Finally, practically all of that ""new"" money would have come from economic efficiency and not ""stolen"" from someone else, investment bubbles or not. That efficiency is called ""progress"", for those of you in The People's Republics of Berkeley or Cambridge. It means more and better stuff, cheaper, over time -- a terrible, petit-bourgeois concept apparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite, or you'd know about it by now. In economic terms, it's also called an increase in general welfare, and, no, Virginia, I'm not talking about extorting money from someone who works, and giving it to someone who doesn't in order to keep them from working and they can think of some politician as Santa Claus come election time... In short, then, economics is not a zero sum game, property is not theft, the rich don't get rich off the backs of the poor, and redistributionist labor ""theory"" of value happy horseshit is just that: horseshit, happy or otherwise. To believe otherwise, is -- quite literally, given the time Marx wrote Capital and the Manifesto -- romantic nonsense.

After 20 years without this feature UNIX finally catches up to Windows and has I/O that doesnt [sic] totally suck for nontrivial apps? No way! The point --- my point, the point I was discussing; please don't try to tell me you were trying to make a different point, because I don't care --- is that you had no clue what you were talking about; Unix hasn't been without this feature, and in fact has had it since you were in elementary school, and operating systems without it don't ""totally suck for nontrivial apps"". For what it's worth, glibc has actually implemented the aio_* calls for a while, just in a way that doesn't scale to large numbers of concurrent I/O requests. I find references to the glibc implementation as far back as 1999 and glibc 2.1.1, and I could probably find much earlier references if I had time: http://sources.redhat.com/ml/libc-hacker/1999-12/msg00070.html (more details at http://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/rgooch/linux/docs/io-events.html; details on the SGI patch are at http://oss.sgi.com/projects/kaio/faq.html) > > Unix has been multiprocess since 1969, and most Unix implementations > > have supported multithreading for a decade or more. > > And most UNIX is still kinda-sorta supporting the pthreads (POSIX) > interface, each in their own 7/8 implementation. You're safe if you > stick to the basics. Your original complaint was that Unix didn't do multithreading or multiprogramming well. Now that I've pointed out how obviously idiotic that claim is, you've amended your complaint: now, although individual Unixes do these things well, you complain that their implementations are not entirely conformant with the POSIX threads specification. Well, that's probably true, but I haven't written pthreads programs in C much myself, so I can't confirm it from my own experience. But, even if it's true, it's not a very good reason to prefer Windows. I'm sure you can provide examples of bugs in particular threading implementations. Spare us.

joelonsoftware <rssfeeds@example.com>,We're trying to decide if FogBUGZ 3.0 should support custom fields. Histor,"URL: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/20020912.html Date: Not supplied We're trying to decide if FogBUGZ[1] 3.0 should support custom fields. Historically, I am opposed to custom fields in principle, because they get abused. People add so many fields to their bug databases to capture everything they think might be important that entering a bug is like applying to Harvard. End result: people don't enter bugs, which is much, much worse than not capturing all that information. You can always ""page fault"" to get the information if the original report forgot it. Rather than having a field in every bug where you enter the version numbers of every DLL on your machine (this is an actual customer request), information which is likely to be relevant only for a tiny percentage of bugs, why not just have the programmer-assignee look at the bug first, and if they think it might be dll-version-related, only _then_ bounce the bug back to the originator asking for the DLL info? Similarly, it's always tempting to add a field in which you ask for the OS version in which the bug occurred. This sounds logical, but trust me: adding fields like this is guaranteed to do one thing and one thing only: reduce the number of bug reports that get into the system in the first place. Only a small percentage of bugs are really OS dependant and you can always include that info in the text description of the bug if it happens to be relevant. (But then how do you search for, say, all bugs which only happen on Windows 98SE? Aha! You can't. Ever. Even with the custom field. Because not every bug has been regressed on every version of every operating system, so this search doesn't make sense in the first place. The info wasn't captured. Do a full text search for 98SE and you'll find some of them. Life is imperfect.) Life would be more perfect if every bug report included megabytes of information -- a complete dump of every byte on the hard drive and in RAM on the computer in question and while you're at it, a photograph of the tester's workspace. But the goal of a bug tracking database is to _keep track of bugs_, which, all else being equal, takes priority over making it easy to find them. I have heard countless stories of development teams where the bug tracking package was so high-ceremony that people were afraid to enter bugs in the system, because they didn't know what all those fields were. The _real_ bug-""tracking"" happened in email, post-its, and hallway conversations. Great. A pretty common question we get on the customer service line is, ""does FogBUGZ support custom fields?"" Rather than giving our usual answer (""no. on purpose."") over the last few weeks I've been saying, ""can you please tell me what fields you would need? We're trying to decide whether to implement that feature in 3.0 and we want to know why people need it."" The interesting thing is, almost all of the fields people ask for _are already in FogBUGZ,_ and the other ones, in my educated opinion, shouldn't be fields. And in fact, our existing customers are certainly happy without custom fields. One of our biggest site licenses was sold to a semiconductor company, and I myself wanted to add a custom field for them to keep track of versions of the circuit design, but I didn't, and they never needed it (even though they had been keeping track of it with the old bug tracking package which had custom fields), and they are happy and keep buying more site licenses. But the dilemma for us is that many customers are evaluating bug tracking software and they consider the lack of custom fields to be a major weakness in our product. ""Gosh, even Filemaker has custom fields."" Righto. It's true. And who am I to tell my customers they are wrong? One person who I was talking to yesterday would have used a custom field for something that we already have a built-in field for. This would have made their database confusing and inconsistent and would have definitely caused more problems than it solved. But it's still rude of me to tell customers that we don't have that feature _for their own good_, even though it usually is, and we're losing some sales because of it. Sigh. I guess we could have a custom fields feature but hide it and make it so hard to use that people don't use it. At least we won't lose any sales :) [1] http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBUGZ",0

What is silly and antiquated depends a lot on which country you live in. I don't have statistics on the love half life, but it seems long-term relationships use something else for glue. Clearly our non-silly non-antiquated ideas about relationships have resulted in mostly short-duration relationships and single-parented, dysfunctional kids (not enough of them too boot, so to keep our demographics from completely keeling over we're importing them from places with mostly silly and antiquated ideas).

Strange... all my openssh packages don't explicitly requires a version of openssl. What version of openssh do you have? Is it an official Red Hat package? I suppose it isn't, and using Red Hat's rpms will solve your problem.

"""Mr. FoRK"" <fork_list@hotmail.com>",Dinosaurs Eggs and the Origins of Good and Evil,"One of the most bizarre pages I've seen on the Web. At first I thought it might be some sort of back-story to a RPG, but, nope, it looks like somebody believes this. === http://www.viking-z.org/r20i.htm M09. Dinosaurs Eggs and the Origins of Good and Evil. DINOSAURS. Reptoid ETs are reported to be 12 foot high crocodiles walking on their hind legs. This is a description of a dinosaur. It now appears in Remote Viewing that the Reptoid ETs, dinosaurs and dragons are all linked together and that they all originated on Earth. The Erideans who are Reptoid derivatives have a home planet (in the Eridanus system) like all other ETs. The Reptoids have no reported home planet. They also come over as entities with little brain who control their bodies directly by spirit. This is a description of a ghost or disincarnate entity regardless of how people see them. Thus it could be that the Reptoids, Erideans, Nordics, Anunnaki, but not the Greys, all have origins on Earth and have a strong link to Earth even if they choose to live elsewhere. The Greys do not appear to have a renal or urinary system and this points to them not originating on Earth. The definitive work on dragons is ""The Flight of Dragons"" by Peter Dickinson. If dragons did exist in the flesh, they did not survive the long bow. Targets do not come much bigger. Truth is stranger than fiction. Thus the writer's current scenario is that there were a race of dinosaurs which developed psychic intelligence to guard their eggs and young, and who probably preferred to live underground. They survived the wipe out of the dinosaurs 50 million years ago with difficulty. They evolved into the Erideans and transferred to a more hospitable planet (for them) possibly with the help of another race of ETs who wanted slaves but otherwise had no interest in Earth or mind control. Thus it appears that the current Reptoids are the Spirits or ghosts of the dinosaurs. They must have been powerful to survive 50 million years and also to appear to some people. They have appeared to the writer in remote viewing. They are living on as vampire entities. Such immortal minds are contagious and can easily jump race and species barriers. If they can be encouraged to reincarnate, then the power sources of the black magicians and mind controllers will disappear. Encouraging them to reincarnate will help so called immortal minds to disappear as immortal minds have great difficulty surviving reincarnation. Purging people's dinosaurs should remove all perverse psychic abilities not under their control. They are a source of Satanic Guardian Angels and demons. They control us by owning our psi. Thus if we regain ownership of psi, we must relinquish their control and that of all other mind controllers. Encourage people to regain ownership of their psi. THE ORIGINS OF LOVE, HATE AND PURE MALICE. The following scenario appears to hold water and can account for the origins of our Universal Subconscious. Dinosaurs laid their eggs and buried them either underground or in piles of rotting vegetation (a good source of beetles and grubs for young hatchelings). They did not sit on their eggs to keep them warm, which made them very vulnerable to drastic climate and temperature change. In order to keep away predators some at least developed psychic mind control. To do this they had to capture ownership of the psi of potential predators. This is an act of hatred and outward looking. While a few dinosaurs did develop the ability to bear living young, most did not. The dinosaurs got in first and so their mind control tends to override all other latter minds. They have become the source of all Satans, devils and demons. Birds on the other hand developed the ability to sit on their eggs and keep them warm. A hen bird normally lays a series of eggs (say one per day) and only starts sitting when the clutch is completely laid. Thus all eggs tend to hatch together as they all have an equal period of warmth. This is primarily an act of love but inward looking. Bearing live young is not suitable to a bird of the air. A pregnant pigeon would not fly very far. Antarctic penguins tuck a single egg between their legs to keep it warm, even if they are standing on ice. Mammals developed live bearing of their young which is also primarily an act of love and inward looking. This is especially true as a mammalian female can not desert her young in the womb in case of emergency as can a bird sitting on a nest. Dinosaurs developed hate and mind control of others to protect their young, while birds and mammals developed love. Birds and mammals certainly do hate all enemies of their young, but this is secondary. If one wants to purge the sources of malice of say a black magician, then purge his dinosaurs and his dinosaur eggs. Unfortunately most of our religions are based on dinosaur protection of eggs and thus mind control, regardless of the front they put out to the public. Religion tends to concentrate on ""How to Brainwash your Neighbour"". Conscious thought has built many mighty empires, theologies and slave control systems out of using ""How to care for and protect one's young"" as a foundation. Thus the foulest form of abuse possible is to call something ""A load of dinosaur's eggs"". Purging the dinosaurs and dinosaur's eggs of any entity tends to purge all malice back to its roots. It looks as if mighty immortal minds have built up from small beginnings, aided and abetted by various occultists and other. As they will insist on vampiring the living for energy to avoid reincarnation and disturbing the serenity of the writer, he encourages them to reincarnate. ITEMS FOR INSPECTION. For mind control to take place, then someone must take control or ownership of the target's psi and pleasure centres. Check for the following. Nest of dinosaur's eggs, holy dinosaurs, etc. Eggs, controllers or owners in peoples psi, pleasure centres, pain killing hormones, abilities, etc. Mind machines. The original engraving or engram. GOD and SATAN appear to be job titles and not entities in their own right. T hey appear to be dinosaur engravings or engrams. No doubt dinosaurs were the first job holders. TIMETRACKS are worth investigating as our complete history from the start of time. My, our, Man's timetracks, etc. The time tracks of the Universe, Universal Subconscious, Galactic Subconscious, etc. EXTINCT RACES of ETs can cause problems when they live on in vampire mode. Their virtues may known to channelers but they can also have vices. Whenever one hears of races which have evolved on to higher planes, suspect that the higher plane is a vampire one. One may never know what they looked like or other basic characteristics, which makes linking back a trifle difficult. Every extinct race, etc. BLOOD ANCESTORS are also worth investigating as minds can be passed down via genetic linkages. Some of these can be over 2,000 years old. Every blood ancestor, ancestral mind, genetic mind, etc.",0

Martin Adamson <martin@srv0.ems.ed.ac.uk>,[zzzzteana] Meaningful sentences,"The Scotsman Thu 22 Aug 2002 Meaningful sentences Tracey Lawson If you ever wanted to look like ""one of the most dangerous inmates in prison history"", as one judge described Charles Bronson, nows your chance. Bronson - the serial hostage taker, not the movie star - has written a health and fitness guide in which he shares some of the secrets behind his legendary muscle power. Solitary Fitness - a title which bears testament to the fact that Bronson, 48, has spent 24 of his 28 prison years in solitary confinement - explains how he has turned himself into a lean, mean, fitness machine while living 23 hours a day in a space just 12 feet by eight feet, on a diet of scrubs grub and at virtually no cost. The book is aimed at those who want to get fabulously fit without spending a fortune on gym memberships, protein supplements or designer trainers, and starts with a fierce attack on some of the expensive myths churned out by the exercise industry. ""I pick up a fitness mag, I start to laugh and I wipe my arse with it,"" is the opening paragraph penned by Bronson. ""Its a joke and a big con and they call me a criminal!"" You cant help feeling he has a point. This is not the first book that Bronson has written from behind bars, having already published Birdman Opens His Mind, which features drawings and poems created by Bronson while in prison. And he is not the first prisoner to discover creative expression while residing at Her Majestys pleasure. Jimmy Boyle, the Scots sculptor and novelist, discovered his artistic talents when he was sent to Barlinnie Prisons famous special unit, which aimed to help inmates put their violent pasts behind them by teaching them how to express their emotions artistically. Boyle was sentenced to life for the murder of ""Babs"" Rooney in 1967. Once released, he moved to Edinburgh where he has become a respected artist. His first novel, Hero of the Underworld, was published in 1999 and his autobiography, A Sense of Freedom, was made into an award-winning film. Hugh Collins was jailed for life in 1977 for the murder of William Mooney in Glasgow, and in his first year in Barlinnie prison stabbed three prison officers, earning him an extra seven-year sentence. But, after being transferred to the same unit that Boyle attended, he learned to sculpt and developed an interest in art. He later published Autobiography of a Murderer, a frank account of Glasgows criminal culture in the 1960s, which received critical praise. And Lord Archer doesnt seem to have had trouble continuing to write the books that have made him millions while in jail. He recently signed a three-book deal with Macmillan publishers worth a reported £10 million, and is no doubt scribbling away as we speak. So why is it that men like Collins, Bronson and Boyle, who can be so destructive towards society on the outside, can become so creative once stuck on the inside? Steve Richards, Bronsons publisher, has published many books about criminal figures and believes the roots of this phenomenon are both pragmatic and profound. He says: ""Prison is sometimes the first time some criminals will ever have known a stable environment, and this can be the first time they have the chance to focus on their creative skills. ""It may also be the first time that they have really had the chance of an education, if their early years have been hard. It could be the first time anyone has offered them the chance to explore their creative talents."" However, Richards believes the reasons are also deeper than that. He says: ""Once they are behind bars, the cold light of day hits them, and they examine the very essence of who they are. ""They ask themselves, am I a man who wants to be remembered for violence? Or am I a man who can contribute to society, who can be remembered for something good?"" Bronson - who was born Michael Gordon Peterson, but changed his name to that of the Hollywood star of the Death Wish films - has, so far, been remembered mainly for things bad. He was originally jailed for seven years for armed robbery in 1974, and has had a series of sentences added to his original term over the years as a result of attacking people in prison. In 2000 he was jailed for life after being convicted of holding a teacher hostage for nearly two days during a jail siege. Standing five feet ten and a half inches tall and weighing 210lbs, he is renowned for his strength. He has bent metal cell doors with his bare hands and does up to 3,000 - yes, 3,000 - press-ups a day. As he puts it: ""I can hit a man 20 times in four seconds, I can push 132 press ups in 60 seconds."" But judging by our current obsession with health and exercise, Solitary Fitness might be the book which will see Bronsons face sitting on every coffee table in the land. He might be the man to give us the dream body which so many so-called fitness gurus promise but fail to motivate us into. Because Bronson has learned to use words as powerfully as he can use his fists. ""All this crap about high-protein drinks, pills, diets, its just a load of bollocks and a multi-million-pound racket,"" he writes, in what can only be described as a refreshingly honest style. ""We can all be fat lazy bastards, its our choice, Im sick of hearing and reading about excuses, if you stuff your face with shit you become shit, thats logical to me."" As motivational mantras go, that might be just the kick up the, er, backside we all needed.

That idea looks good although it maybe needs to be tweaked a bit more (what you sent doesn't support packages named ""kernel-smp""). I'd also prefer a cleaner way than the env variable, and preferrably not editing the spec... probably ""--define 'target 2.4.xx-xx' --with smp"". Sound good enough? The BuildRequires on ""kernel-source"" will also need to be removed because it won't necessarily need to be true, and that does bug me a bit :-/ More ideas are welcome.

Agreed, not much difference there. With C it just doesnt seem as wrong to be crawling around in registers and things. Quite frankly you cant fit _that_ big of a project into a 32K ROM, so large project issues dont matter as much in the embedded world.

Seems like every CD player should include the capability to rip, encode, and cache the last few CDs inserted. Playback would then never need to face seek delays... after the initial ripping, the only use of the laser pickup would be recognizing which CD is inserted -- which might be doable faster than a seek-and-start-at- first-track operation. You could also take the CD out while it is ""playing"". Hmm. If the CD is still in the cache, maybe you don't even have to insert it. Or choose it from a step-through UI. Instead, you just wave it at an electronic eye of some sort... and the player recognizes it from the silkscreening. Kids would like that. ""Play this,"" they'd say, facing the CD at the player, and the player would start immediately. - Gordon",0

Tim Chapman <timc@2ubh.com>,[zzzzteana] Language problems,"Ananova: Newspaper's readers complain over 'let's have sex' picture caption Readers of an African newspaper have complained after a picture caption about jewellery contained the words ""let's have sex"". The mix-up highlights the problems caused by the wide range of languages spoken in Namibia. Callers to the Namibian were angered by the use of the word tulumweni, which translates roughly as ""let's have intercourse"" in the Oshiwambo language. It was used in a caption concerning people in the Caprivi who use rings from the femidon - female condom - as jewellery. According to the The Namibian , an activist involved in care for Aids/HIV patients spelt the word tulumweni for the journalist. He intended it to mean ""you will see for yourselves"" in the Siyeyi tongue. One caller said the complainants ""should be considerate of other people's languages. It is very clear that the picture was taken in the Caprivi ...And that the word is from Siyeyi. It is not Oshiwambo"". Others indicated that various words might have different meanings in various Namibian languages, such as omakende, an Oshiwambo word for glasses which in Siyeyi means testicles. Another word with a double-meaning is tulikunde, which in Oshiwambo translates as let's talk, but which in Sisubiya translates as let's have intercourse. The Herero word for a hat is ekoli, which is an Oshiwambo word for a vagina. Story filed: 12:37 Tuesday 8th October 2002 ------------------------ Yahoo!

"""hyatt@mozilla"" <rssfeeds@example.com>",Priceless,"URL: http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/#85443744 Date: Not supplied I just finished reading an article about Mozilla[1] for Salon.com[2]. This excerpt was rather amusing. _It is a good question, because in almost every way, Mozilla is a better browser than Navigator. For example, Netscape's best new feature, tabbed browsing -- which lets you have several Web pages open in the same browser window, and allows you to bookmark all the pages under one name -- was in Mozilla many months ago, and the Mozilla project that created it (called MultiZilla) already has an improved version available. When asked about this, Yecies, of Netscape, said, ""That's true, but the engineer who's working on it [for Mozilla] is a Netscape employee. It was always done with the intention of fostering general browsing usability for Netscape."" _ Yes, ok, I suppose that's true if by ""Netscape employee"" you really meant ""Apple employee."" and by ""always done with the intention of fostering general browsing usability for Netscape"" you meant ""was done in a weekend for Mozilla because I thought MultiZilla was cool."" Here's how the whole tabbed browsing thing happened. One night I finally downloaded an extension called MultiZilla (go check it out on mozdev.org[3]. I was particularly impressed with a feature contained in MultiZilla called tabbed browsing. I started doing research and discovered NetCaptor[4], a tabbed browser that embedded WinIE. MultiZilla was cool but at the time suffered from two fundamental flaws that prevented the code from being incorporated into the Mozilla tree. The first was a UI flaw, namely that at the time it had ripped off NetCaptor down to the last context menu item. The GUI was similar enough that there would have been definite concerns about so obviously copying some of NetCaptor's more obscure capabilities (like sticky names and tab locking). The second concern was that the tab behavior wasn't encapsulated cleanly into a widget. I produced a simplified version of tabbed browsing on my own time (did it in a weekend) that removed some of the geekier NetCaptor features and that encapsulated the tab behavior so that the changes to other Navigator files would be minimal. Once I established that it didn't degrade performance in the single tab case, I checked it in as an experiment. The response was overwhelming, as were the bugs that started being filed. So much so that at first I wanted to back tabbed browsing out of the tree. I was overruled by Mozilla, which turned out to be a good thing for all I think. :) Even with all the excitement and hoopla surrounding the advent of tabbed browsing on the engineering side (and in the Mozilla community), Netscape still didn't get it. Netscape marketing prioritized all sorts of useless work that nobody had even started above tabbed browsing in their marketing document. They continued to do so for months, simply not getting it. It was this odd curiosity that one of their engineers had checked in, and they didn't know what to make of it. Only after the press raved about it did Netscape really jump on board. I'm sure Netscape is doing the same thing now with popup blocking. Can't you just see it now? We'll have a Popup Manager, and a Manager to manage the Popup Manager, and twenty-seven preferences for fine-grained control of all aspects of popups. Can you believe how disfunctional Netscape is? When their engineers say ""you should do this"" or ""you should do that"", they get completely ignored (or blown off), but when CNet says ""We didn't like this, or we didn't like that."", Netscape scurries to meet their demands. That is simply pathetic. [1] http://archive.salon.com/tech/feature/2002/09/10/browser_wars/ [2] http://www.salon.com [3] http://www.mozdev.org [4] http://www.netcaptor.com",0

However, I looked through ALL the preferences menus, and didn't see anything resembling ""Show unseen message count in folder cache"". Where is that? And in what version? (I'm running v2.4 - 06/23/2000 - Creaky, I know.) I went into twm with no virtual desktops, and it came up just fine. Going back to Enlightenment I saw the same behavior as before. Then I knew it MUST be something in the window manager, so I went digging. in my ~/.englightenment/...e_session-XXXXXX.snapshots.0 file I found all the settings that E. uses for remembering border styles, positions, shaded state, etc. I have a 1600x1200 screen, and it kept putting my window at 1655x150 (AND had it shaded to boot, so it was tiny as well as offscreen!) Searching for 'unseen' in that file found this section: NEW: exmh.Exmh NAME: exmh CLASS: Exmh NEW: unseen.UnseenWin NAME: unseen CLASS: UnseenWin DESKTOP: 0 RES: 1600 1200 WH: 114 173 XY: 1655 150 0 0 LAYER: 4 STICKY: 1 SKIPTASK: 0 SKIPWINLIST: 0 SKIPFOCUS: 0 SHADE: 2 BORDER: PAGER_LEFT_BLUE I changed: XY: 1655 150 0 0 to XY: 1455 150 0 0 so it would reappear in my viewable space, restarted Enlightenment (CTRL-ALT-End) and then restarted exmh. Bingo! There was my window! I quickly told Englightenment to forget everything about that window except is border style, and now have a sveldt little entry like so: NEW: exmh.Exmh NAME: exmh CLASS: Exmh NEW: unseen.UnseenWin NAME: unseen CLASS: UnseenWin BORDER: PAGER_LEFT_BLUE Completely an Enlightenment problem, not exmh. (Though I wonder how it got mixed up in the first place? I certainly can't move a window off screen like that. Unless it was part way over then snapped offscreen when shading.) Hmm. Weird.

It will! Part of my cunning plan involves something like this: if folder == ""accepted"": # ie. not suspected junk mail if (len(recipients) == 1 and recipients[0] in (""guido@python.org"", ""barry@python.org"", ...)): folder = ""personal"" If you (and Guido, Barry, et. al.) prefer, I could change that last statement to ""folder = None"", so the mail won't be saved at all.

You don't need to backup /home if you are careful enough. You did put /home on a separate partition, no ? Just install rh80 and tell it to use the same partition as /home and tell it to NOT format it, but keep the data as is. If you didn't put /home on a separate partition, then you really do need to make backups. Use an nfs or smb mount from another machine to backup and rsync straight to the mount, or if that's not possible, rsync over ssh. It's the best way to make backups. > These media files are backed up - ON THE CD'S THEY CAME FROM!

khare@alumni.caltech.edu,"NYTimes.com Article: Some Friends, Indeed, Do More Harm Than Good","This article from NYTimes.com has been sent to you by khare@alumni.caltech.edu. Sure does explain FoRK :-) not yet abandoned, Rohit khare@alumni.caltech.edu Some Friends, Indeed, Do More Harm Than Good September 10, 2002 By MARY DUENWALD Friends are supposed to be good for you. In recent years, scientific research has suggested that people who have strong friendships experience less stress, they recover more quickly from heart attacks and they are likely to live longer than the friendless. They are even less susceptible to the common cold, studies show. But not all friends have such a salutary effect. Some lie, insult and betray. Some are overly needy. Some give too much advice. Psychologists and sociologists are now calling attention to the negative health effects of bad friends. ""Friendship is often very painful,"" said Dr. Harriet Lerner, a psychologist and the author of ""The Dance of Connection."" ""In a close, enduring friendship, jealousy, envy, anger and the entire range of difficult emotions will rear their heads. One has to decide whether the best thing is to consider it a phase in a long friendship or say this is bad for my health and I'm disbanding it."" Another book, ""When Friendship Hurts,"" by Dr. Jan Yager, a sociologist at the University of Connecticut at Stamford, advises deliberately leaving bad friends by the wayside. ""There's this myth that friendships should last a lifetime,"" Dr. Yager said. ""But sometimes it's better that they end."" That social scientists would wait until now to spotlight the dangers of bad friends is understandable, considering that they have only recently paid close attention to friendship at all. Marriage and family relationships - between siblings or parents and children - have been seen as more important. Of course, troubled friendships are far less likely to lead to depression or suicide than troubled marriages are. And children are seldom seriously affected when friendships go bad. As a popular author of relationship advice books, Dr. Lerner said, ""Never once have I had anyone write and say my best friend hits me."" Dr. Beverley Fehr, a professor of psychology at the University of Winnipeg, noted that sociological changes, like a 50 percent divorce rate, have added weight to the role of friends in emotional and physical health. ""Now that a marital relationship can't be counted on for stability the way it was in the past, and because people are less likely to be living with or near extended family members, people are shifting their focus to friendships as a way of building community and finding intimacy,"" said Dr. Fehr, the author of ""Friendship Processes."" Until the past couple of years, the research on friendship focused on its health benefits. ""Now we're starting to look at it as a more full relationship,"" said Dr. Suzanna Rose, a professor of psychology at Florida International University in Miami. ""Like marriage, friendship also has negative characteristics."" The research is in its infancy. Psychologists have not yet measured the ill effects of bad friendship, Dr. Fehr said. So far they have only, through surveys and interviews, figured out that it is a significant problem. The early research, Dr. Fehr added, is showing that betrayal by a friend can be more devastating than experts had thought. How can a friend be bad? Most obviously, Dr. Rose said, by drawing a person into criminal or otherwise ill-advised pursuit. ""When you think of people who were friends at Enron,"" she added, ""you can see how friendship can support antisocial behavior."" Betrayal also makes for a bad friendship. ""When friends split up,"" said Dr. Keith E. Davis, a professor of psychology at the University of South Carolina, ""it is often in cases where one has shared personal information or secrets that the other one wanted to be kept confidential."" Another form of betrayal, Dr. Yager said, is when a friend suddenly turns cold, without ever explaining why. ""It's more than just pulling away,"" she said. ""The silent treatment is actually malicious."" At least as devastating is an affair with the friend's romantic partner, as recently happened to one of Dr. Lerner's patients. ""I would not encourage her to hang in there and work this one out,"" Dr. Lerner said. A third type of bad friendship involves someone who insults the other person, Dr. Yager said. One of the 180 people who responded to Dr. Yager's most recent survey on friendship described how, when she was 11, her best friend called her ""a derogatory name."" The woman, now 32, was so devastated that she feels she has been unable to be fully open with people ever since, Dr. Yager said. Emotional abuse may be less noticeable than verbal abuse, but it is ""more insidious,"" Dr. Yager said. ""Some people constantly set up their friends,"" she explained. ""They'll have a party, not invite the friend, but make sure he or she finds out."" Risk takers, betrayers and abusers are the most extreme kinds of bad friends, Dr. Yager said, but they are not the only ones. She identifies 21 different varieties. Occupying the second tier of badness are the liar, the person who is overly dependent, the friend who never listens, the person who meddles too much in a friend's life, the competitor and the loner, who prefers not to spend time with friends. Most common is the promise breaker. ""This includes everyone from the person who says let's have a cup of coffee but something always comes up at the last minute to someone who promises to be there for you when you need them, but then isn't,"" Dr. Yager said. Some friendships go bad, as some romantic relationships do, when one of the people gradually or suddenly finds reasons to dislike the other one. ""With couples, it can take 18 to 24 months for someone to discover there's something important they don't like about the other person,"" said Dr. Rose of Florida International. ""One might find, for example, that in subtle ways the other person is a racist. In friendships, which are less intense, it may take even more time for one person to meet the other's dislike criteria."" Whether a friendship is worth saving, Dr. Lerner said, ""depends on how large the injury is."" ""Sometimes the mature thing is to lighten up and let something go,"" she added. ""It's also an act of maturity sometimes to accept another person's limitations."" Acceptance should come easier among friends than among spouses, Dr. Lerner said, because people have more than one friend and do not need a full range of emotional support from each one. But if the friendship has deteriorated to the point where one friend truly dislikes the other one or finds that the friendship is causing undue stress, the healthy response is to pull away, Dr. Yager said, to stop sharing the personal or intimate details of life, and start being too busy to get together, ever. ""It takes two people to start and maintain a friendship, but only one to end it,"" Dr. Yager said. Friendship, because it is voluntary and unregulated, is far easier to dissolve than marriage. But it is also comparatively fragile, experts say. Ideally, the loss of a bad friendship should leave a person with more time and appreciation for good ones, Dr. Lerner said. ""It is wise to pay attention to your friendships and have them in order while you're healthy and your life and work are going well,"" she said. ""Because when a crisis hits, when someone you love dies, or you lose your job and your health insurance, when the universe gives you a crash course in vulnerability, you will discover how crucial and life-preserving good friendship is."" http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/10/health/psychology/10FRIE.html?ex=1032684795&ei=1&en=2a88a6d1b985c977 HOW TO ADVERTISE --------------------------------- For information on advertising in e-mail newsletters or other creative advertising opportunities with The New York Times on the Web, please contact onlinesales@nytimes.com or visit our online media kit at http://www.nytimes.com/adinfo For general information about NYTimes.com, write to help@nytimes.com.

boingboing <rssfeeds@example.com>,Japa-crappers get high-tech,"URL: http://boingboing.net/#85541025 Date: Not supplied Japanese toilet technology has developed creeping featuritis. New Tokyo toities sport speech-recognition, air-conditioning, and body-chemistry monitors: Japan's toilet wars started in February, when Matsushita engineers here unveiled a toilet seat equipped with electrodes that send a mild electric charge through the user's buttocks, yielding a digital measurement of body-fat ratio. Unimpressed, engineers from a rival company, Inax, counterattacked in April with a toilet that glows in the dark and whirs up its lid after an infrared sensor detects a human being. When in use, the toilet plays any of six soundtracks, including chirping birds, rushing water, tinkling wind chimes, or the strumming of a traditional Japanese harp.

Tom <tomwhore@slack.net>,Apple Sauced...again,"Over on Arstechnica (www.arstechnica.com) I saw mention of a Wired article that goes into the many wonderfull ways Apple is showing its love and respect for its users. http://www.wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,55395,00.html There is a good rundown of all the whys and whatfores over at http://arstechnica.com/reviews/02q3/macosx-10.2/macosx-10.2-5.html ""True to form, industrious third party developers saw that they could gain a competitive advantage by supporting this more capable user interface in their applications. Apple's private menu extras APIs were reverse engineered and leveraged to great effect. The architecture was so popular that an application for managing predefined sets of menu extras (third party or otherwise) was in development. All of that changed with the release of Jaguar--but not because the private APIs had changed. If they had, third party developers would have updated their applications to work with the new APIs, as they have resigned themselves to doing by choosing to use private APIs in the first place. But what actually happened in Jaguar was that Apple added code to forcibly exclude all non-Apple menu extras. Other parts of the API did not change. But when a menu extra is loaded, it is compared to a hard-coded list of ""known"" menu extras from Apple. If the menu extra is not on that list, it is not allowed to load. It's easy to laugh at Steve Ballmer's sweat-soaked gyrations as he chants ""developers, developers, developers!"", but Microsoft clearly understands something that Apple is still struggling with. It is in a platform vendor's best interest to encourage development for its platform. In Apple's case, this doesn't mean that they have to bend over backwards to make every single system service and UI element ""pluggable"" via public APIs. That's clearly a lot of work, and not something that needs to be the number one priority for an OS in its infancy. And in the meantime, if third party developers want to sell into a market that requires the desired functionality to be added in ""unsupported"" ways, then they must be prepared for the maintenance consequences of their decisions. But for Apple to go out of its way--to actually expend developer effort--to stop these third party developers, while still failing to provide a supported alternative, is incredibly foolish. """,0

Red Hat 8.0 ships with the bytecode hinter enabled; I think 7.3 may have as well. The enabling change to ""ftoption.h"" is made by Red Hat's SRPM before building. Take a look at ""freetype-2.1.1-enable-ft2-bci.patch"" from the SRPM; it's pretty clear that this does exactly what needs to be done.

This is a good thing. Getting hammered for stupid investments is likely to result in smarter investments in the future. Nobody is supposed to win all the time, particularly not people who don't do due diligence. ""A fool and his money are soon parted"" and all that. It isn't the job of the FTC/SEC/IRS/etc to make sure you invest your money wisely (and I have grave doubts that they could even if it was their job). > They > finished their routine with the a quadruple lutz -- laying off > hundreds of thousands of workers when it all came crashing down.

Would any one be able to set me straight? ./configure --with-emacs --prefix=/usr/local/src/beta/w3 --exec-prefix=/usr/ local/src/beta/w3 --with-url=/url/url That worked fine so I moved to the next step. make At the bottem of the text I got the following messages: Cannot open load file: /url/url/url-vars.el make[1]: *** [custom-load.el] Error 255 make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/src/beta/w3/lisp' make: *** [w3] Error 2 When I got around to trying the url package I had no problems.

Actually, if I remember correctly from discussion of the list's composition in Forbes about five or six years ago, the *best* way to get on the Forbes 400 is to have *no* college at all. Can you say ""Bootstraps"", boys and girls? I knew you could... [Given that an undergraduate liberal arts degree from a state school, like, say, mine, :-), is nothing but stuff they should have taught you in a government-run ""high"" school, you'll probably get more of *those* on the Forbes 400 as well as time goes on. If we ever get around to having a good old fashioned government-collapsing transfer-payment depression (an economic version of this summer's government-forest conflagration, caused by the same kind of innumeracy that not clear-cutting enough forests did out west this summer :-)) that should motivate more than a few erst-slackers out there, including me, :-), to learn to actually feed themselves.] The *next* category on the Forbes 400 list is someone with a ""terminal"" professional degree, like an MBA, PhD, MD, etc., from the best school possible. Why? Because, as of about 1950, the *best* way to get into Harvard, for instance, is to be *smart*, not rich. Don't take my word for it, ask their admissions office. Look at the admissions stats over the years for proof. Meritocracy, American Style, was *invented* at the Ivy League after World War II. Even Stanford got the hint, :-), and, of course, Chicago taught them all how, right? :-). Practically *nobody* who goes to a top-20 American institution of higher learning can actually afford to go there these days. Unless, of course, their parents, who couldn't afford to go there themselves, got terminal degrees in the last 40 years or so. And their kids *still* had to get the grades, and ""biased"" (by intelligence :-)), test scores, to get in. The bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with ""terminal"" degrees, until they actually *own* something and *hire* people, or learn to *make* something for a living all day on a profit and loss basis, persist in the practically insane belief, like life after death, that economics is some kind of zero sum game, that dumb people who don't work hard for it make all the money, and, if someone *is* smart, works hard, and is rich, then they stole their wealth somehow. BTW, none of you guys out there holding the short end of this rhetorical stick can blame *me* for the fact that I'm using it to beat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders. You were, apparently, too dumb to grab the right end. *I* went to Missouri, and *I* don't have a degree in anything actually useful, much less a ""terminal"" one, which means *I*'m broker than anyone on this list -- it's just that *you*, of all people, lots with educations far surpassing my own, should just plain know better. The facts speak for themselves, if you just open your eyes and *look*. There are no epicycles, the universe does not orbit the earth, and economics is not a zero-sum game. The cost of anything, including ignorance and destitution, is the forgone alternative, in this case, intelligence and effort. [I will, however, admit to being educated *waay* past my level of competence, and, by the way *you* discuss economics, so have you, apparently.] BTW, if we ever actually *had* free markets in this country, *including* the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes, all those smart people in the Forbes 400 would have *more* money, and there would be *more* self-made people on that list. In addition, most of the people who *inherited* money on the list would have *much* less of it, not even relatively speaking. Finally, practically all of that ""new"" money would have come from economic efficiency and not ""stolen"" from someone else, investment bubbles or not. That efficiency is called ""progress"", for those of you in The People's Republics of Berkeley or Cambridge. It means more and better stuff, cheaper, over time -- a terrible, petit-bourgeois concept apparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite, or you'd know about it by now. In economic terms, it's also called an increase in general welfare, and, no, Virginia, I'm not talking about extorting money from someone who works, and giving it to someone who doesn't in order to keep them from working and they can think of some politician as Santa Claus come election time... In short, then, economics is not a zero sum game, property is not theft, the rich don't get rich off the backs of the poor, and redistributionist labor ""theory"" of value happy horseshit is just that: horseshit, happy or otherwise. To believe otherwise, is -- quite literally, given the time Marx wrote Capital and the Manifesto -- romantic nonsense.

Consider it on my list of things to check. Well, unfortunately, I appear to be using a window manager that doesn't support the icon window. However, I did fix some bugs in the related ""Hide When Empty"" functionality which may solve the issue. You may need to remove ""unseen"" from the ""always show sequences"" to make this work.

You still need to have the rpm for the specified kernel installed, but at least it doesn't have to be currently running.

The vast majority (all but, say, 10) have never ever existed. Yet, spammers would semi-continuously connect, try to deliver mail to 40 of them, disconnect, connect again, try delivering to 40 more... over and over, they kept getting ""User unknown"" until I got around to making them spamtraps. So my evidence would suggest that it depends who you're dealing with. :) If your ""business"" is to sell address lists to people who would then spam, it's in your best interest to never clean your list. Therefore you can say ""10 million email addresses"" and not technically be lying, even if the majority of them don't work. If you're a spammer, you'd want to know who doesn't actually exist, but then again you don't really care: you probably want to relay through someone so it's harder to trace you, if you could you'd send to every email address available, you don't want to setup a valid bounce address because again it's easy to trace you. So I would say this, if you technically spam people but actually think you're running a legit service, you probably really do have a way of opting out (even though the user didn't opt in) and you probably don't relay, and you probably pay attention to bounces. Everyone else doesn't really care. That's my view anyway. :) -- Randomly Generated Tagline: ""Now you can do that thing with your hands... It's ok."" - Prof. Farr",0

This does nothing to answer my question. I *do* care about content. Hell, if I could be convinced that people would send stupid pics back and forth all day, I'd have a different opinion of this. I just am not convinced that they will (stupid or not). While a picture may be worth a thousand words (and this is the same argument the guy who works for me made), how many people do you know who communicate by pictures? Sure, it sounds nice to say that a picture is such an efficient messaging mechanism, but how often do you actually find yourself drawing someone a picture to explain something? I don't buy it. For most messages, text works fine and is the most efficient mechanism. For some messages, pictures do the job, but I would say not nearly as often as words. Why do you think Pictionary and Charades and such are games? Because images are usually not the most efficient way to get a message across. >misc ramblings: i suppose you skeptical forkers would have said the same >thing about '1 hour photo' processing. trivial, who needs it, i get better >resultion elswhere. and yet, it had great decentralizing impact - the plant >had to be downsized and pushed to the retail operation - the digital camera, >and finally the integrated digital camera phone brings this cycle of >decentralization in photography to a logical conclusion (which will put the >photo giants to bed) and change the world in a meaningful way. also, SMS >didn't take off because its easy, it took off because it costs less. its >greatly ironic the carriers often trumpet the 'profitabilty' of their SMS >traffic over others because of its ratio of cost to bandwidth. in reality, >SMS cannibilizes the voice rev's they bought their networks to handle. Again, this is the same argument my colleague made (along with ""you just don't understand kids today, and they'll run with this""). I wasn't saying that MMS wouldn't take off because it wasn't high quality or that it wasn't easy. I was saying that I couldn't see why people would use it in a way that ""changed the face of communications"". I'm looking for the compelling reason (even if it's a stupid one) why people would want to do this. Sure, if they integrate cameras into the phone, and the quality improves (even only marginally) I can certainly see people taking pictures with their cameras and occasionally sending them to other people. But, mostly, I don't see what the benefit is to this over sending them to someone's email address, or putting together an online (or offline) photoalbum. I don't think 1 hour photos are trivial. People want to see their own pics right away, and the quality is plenty good enough for snapshots. That's one of the main reasons why digital cameras are catching on. The instant view part. I'm guessing your argument is that people not only want ""instant view"", but also ""instant show"". Which is what this service offers. I'm not convinced that most people want ""instant show"". I think people like to package their pictures and show them. That's why people put together fancy albums, and sit there and force you to go through them while they explain every picture. Sure, occasionally ""instant show"" is nice, but it's just ""nice"" on occasion. I still can't see how it becomes a integral messaging method. What's the specific benefit of taking a picture and immediately sending it from one phone to another? There has to be *some* benefit, even if it's silly if people are going to flock to it. I'm searching... no one has given me a straight answer yet. The *only* really intriguing idea I've heard about things like MMS lately are Dan Gillmor's assertion that one day in the near future some news event will happen, and a bunch of people will snap pictures with their mobile phones, from all different angles, and those photos tell the real story of what happened - before the press even gets there. Willing to be proven wrong, Mike PS If the wireless carriers continue to price these services as stupidly as they currently are, then MMS is *never* going to catch on. http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",0
Dan Kohn <dan@dankohn.com>,RE: [SAtalk] O.T. Habeus -- Why?,"Guys, the Habeas Infringers List (HIL) exists explicitly to deal with spammers while we're getting judgments against them and especially in other countries, where those judgments are harder to get. Please note that nobody has ever had an incentive before to go after regular spammers. Yes, some attorneys general have prosecuted blatant pyramid schemes, and ISPs have won some theft of service suits, but the vast majority of spammers go forward with out any legal hassles. So, I can't understand how Daniel can assert that you can't track spammers down when it's never really been tried. We can subpoena the records of the business they spammed on behalf of. We can subpoena the records of the ISP that provided them service, and of the credit card they used for the whack-a-mole accounts. We can use private investigators. Yes, these people are often lowlifes (chickenboners). But, they're not secret agents. They're just trying to make a buck, and Habeas' whole business is about finding them and putting them out of business Habeas has the incentive to pursue spammers (that use our warrant mark) in a way that no one ever has had before. Given that our whole business plan relies on Habeas becoming synonymous with ""not spam"", I can't understand why you would assume ahead of time that we will be unsuccessful, plan for that failure, and in so doing, remove the potential of success, which is anti-spam filters like SA acting on the Habeas warrant mark. Daniel, it's easy enough for you to change the Habeas scores yourself on your installation. If Habeas fails to live up to its promise to only license the warrant mark to non-spammers and to place all violators on the HIL, then I have no doubt that Justin and Craig will quickly remove us from the next release. But, you're trying to kill Habeas before it has a chance to show any promise. At the end of the day, SpamAssassin is like the Club, in that it encourages thieves (spammers) to just go after the next car (those without SA) rather than yours. Habeas can play the role of LoJack (the transmitter), in enabling the apprehension of thieves so that they don't steal any more cars.

Just a few notes: - It will be difficult to find, prosecute, and win money from someone in various non-friendly countries where spam originates (China is a good example) even if they do officially ""respect"" copyright law. - Law suits take time. Between now and conclusion of the first court case, we could have years of spam in our mail boxes! - Contact information can change: phone numbers, PO boxes, stolen cell phones, temporary email addresses, etc. - Spammers do not always remember to include contact information! I don't understand it either, but nobody said they were bright. Also, some spam is non-commercial or sent by a third-party (for example, ""pump and dump"" stock scams), so contact information is not strictly required for the spammer to get their way.

My impression is that a pre-collected corpus would not fit most individuals very well, but each individual (or group?) should collect their own corpus. One problem that comes upp immediately: individuals are lazy. If I currently get 50 spam and 50 ham a day, and I'll have to press the 'delete' button once for each spam, I'll be happy to press the 'spam' button instead. However, if in addition have to press a 'ham' button for each ham, it starts to look much less like a win to me. Add the time to install and setup the whole machinery, and I'll just keep hitting delete. The suggestions so far have been to hook something on the delete action, that adds a message to the ham corpus. I see two problems with this: the ham will be a bit skewed; mail that I keep around without deleting will not be counted. Secondly, if I by force of habit happen to press the 'delete' key instead of the 'spam' key, I'll end up with spam in the ham, anyways. I would like to look for a way to deal with spam in the ham. The obvious thing to do is to trigger on the 'spam' button, and at that time look for messages similar to the deleted one in the ham corpus, and simply remove them. To do this we need a way to compare two word count histograms, to see how similar they are. Any ideas ? Also, I personally would prefer to not see the spam at all. If they get bounced (preferably already in the SMTP), false positives become the senders problem, to rewrite to remove the spam smell. In a well tuned system then, there spam corpus will be much smaller than the ham corpus, so it would be possible to be slightly over-agressive when clearing potential spam from the ham corpus. This should make it easier to keep it clean. Having a good way to remove spam from the ham corpus, there's less need to worry about it getting there by mistake, and we might as well simply add all messages to the ham corpus, that didn't get deleted by the spam filtering. It might also be useful to have a way to remove messages from the spam corpus, in case of user ooops. /Paul",0

Unlike everyone else, they decided to search my suitcase. The security lady asked for permission and then took everything out: clothing, umbrellas, a jacket, and a box of crackers. She searched all the pockets: nothing. Apparently the jacket was suspicious; She sent it through again. Nothing. The lady in the next lane waved a 10-inch knife and asked the lady in my lane if it could go on. I can only assume she answered yes. She put everything back in and sent it through again. Still suspicious. They took everything out. It looked like this was going to take a while, so I used the opportunity to put the tickets I was holding back in my bag. When I looked back up, the security woman was brandishing a scissors and saying ""This can't go on board."" ""I don't remember packing that,"" I said. I let her confiscate it. I called my Mom. She doesn't remember packing it either. Is there some sort of terrorist plot to plant scissors in innocent-looking people's suitcases? I can't see why this would be useful. How would they know what plane I'm on? Once I'm on the plane how would they get the scissors? They could threaten me, but if they have a threatening implement already, then why do they need the scissors? Perhaps it's some sort of Matroishca-doll system. They use their fists to get the infant to give them the squeaky mouse, they use the squeaky mouse to scare the toddler into giving them a copy of _A New Kind of Science_, they use ANKS to bludgeon a 5th Grader into giving them a wedge block, and they use the wedge to get me to give them the scissors. Those are some pretty clever terrorists. *Update:* False alarm. My Mom called. Apparently it was the scissors she was using to cut loose threads from my tie last night. It must have fallen in. The nation can go back to Yellow Level Terrorist Alert. === Waiting for Wireless === Now I am at O'Hare Airport, sitting outside the Admiral's Club while businessmen walk in and out. I am looking for a wireless signal, the signal I used last time I was here, but not finding it. Of course, last time I was here, I had an Admiral's Club card. This time I have a Mileage Plus Card, but despite the airline ologopoly--or perhaps because of it (have to keep up appearances, you know)--I doubt they will accept it. === Irony === According to the announcement I just heard, Mr. Valenti is going to miss his flight. I think of what I'd say if I ran into him. ""Jack!"" I'd exclaim, as if we were old pals. ""Going to the Eldred case?"" Of course he was. ""Going to be a good one."" ""Hey, remember when you had that debate with Lessig?"" I'd ask. ""You said you were starting a new task force to make movies legitimately available on the Internet. What ever happened to that?"" I imagine him mumbling and looking down at his watch. His plane is going to leave soon; he has to run. Another announcement: Mr. Michael McKenna needs to call his office. Good thing these airline announcements keep me up to date. === Automatic Flush Toilets === Now I am short and the sensing system was mounted up tall in both instances. In the first, at my old high school (where you think some people might be a little short...), the flush went off once accidentally. OK, I thought, I can handle one mistake. Then it went off again. Here at the airport, it misfired three times. This is annoying and inexcusable. Have they not heard of user testing? Do they expect only tall people to use these bathrooms? This problem must be remedied immediately. I recommend releasing a Service Pack on the manufacturer's web site. === Arrival === I've arrived in D.C.--once again, I'm sitting a block away from my hotel on the sidewalk borrowing someone's connection. Trip was very smooth, had lunch with Lisa and went to the Spy Museum (pretty cool, but could have been better). Now for the meetings and parties. Sorry for not responding to your email.

Reg Clemens <reg@dwf.com>,(PGP problem) EXMH hangs during 'Query keyserver',"I guess the first question here should be does anyone have some updates to the PGP code in EXMH that I should know about? My current problem is that if I get a PGP signed message, I first get a button that reads: ""Check the signature with GnuPG"" If I punch the button, and I dont have the signature on my keyring then I get a message saying just that, and the message: ""Can't check signature: public key not found"" along with a button with the inscription ""Query keyserver"" If I punch the button then EXMH just hangs. Forever. If instead of punching the button, I go out to the keyserver myself and then try the message again, everything works, so it SEEMS that it must be the code that goes out to the keyserver. Anyone else with this problem?

As Dan said -- it's a hard corpus, made harder without the spamtrap data. Also -- and this is an important point -- those measurements can't be directly compared, because I changed the methodology. In 2.40 the scores were evolved on the entire corpus, then evaluated using that corpus; ie. there was no ""blind"" testing, and the scores could overfit and still provide good statistics. In 2.42, they're evaluated ""blind"", on a totally unseen set of messages, so those figures would be a lot more accurate for real-world use. --j.",0

If Habeas is going to die just because SA does not support it, that's a serious problem with the business model; but that is nobody's problem but Habeas's. A possible solution is for Habeas's business model to include some kind of incentive for users of SA to give it the benefit of the doubt.

eric nichols <matchsprint@trackbike.com>,[ILUG] PCTel modules,"Hello again. I tried all the suggestions for the PCTel driver and at the end of it, everything still goes smoothly until I type ""make"" after I get the output from the ./configure. However, there were a couple of things I noticed along the way. After typing * cp configs/kernel-2.4...config .config * make oldconfig * make dep The 2nd to last line I got back said that the modversions.h file was not updated. When I looked at this path to the modversions.h file, it was 281 lines and every line started with a # mark. Is it the case that nothing is read on a line after a # mark (or am I just thinking of another language?) and so should I delete the # at certain places? Also, when I was in the pctel directory and typed ""make"", I noticed that a different subdirectory is taken to a different modversions.h file. Inside this other file, there's nothing at all. And so I moved the modversions.h file with 281 lines to the empty modversions.h file - and got a different reply after ""make"". The output after I moved the file over mostly looked like this: /usr/src/linux-2.4.18-3/linux/modversions.h:11:33: linux/modules/adb.ver: No such file or directory /usr/src/linux-2.4.18-3/linux/modversions.h:12:37: linux/modules/af_ax25.ver: No such file or directory /usr/src/linux-2.4.18-3/linux/modversions.h:13:36: linux/modules/af_ipx.ver: No such file or directory The odd lines being the path and the first half of the other lines are what's written after the # in the modversions.h file. Should there be a file at each of these (one at each of the 281 lines of the file) that I'd have to compile/make? It's taken plenty of elbow grease, but I'm glad it hasn't gone smoothly, it's a good learning experience. Again, any help is appreciated.

There was a fascinating article in the Economist 1-2 weeks back (the issue with a pregnant-looking Statue of Liberty on the Front) that stated that even for the native US population, fertility had jumped in the last decade and a half. I think the current figure for the US is a little over 2, but not quite the ~2.1 of replacement rate. Combined with the very fertile non-native population, the article implied the US was going to have a significant increase in population over earlier predictions. As well, the population would overall be more youthful, with associated implications for being able to fund social programs, military spending, consumer spending, etc. Europe did not show the same increase in fertility. Some actual data for the US are here: http://www.census.gov/population/pop-profile/2000/chap04.pdf Part of: http://www.census.gov/population/www/pop-profile/profile2000.html - Jim",0

China? Ooops, no wait, scratch that. There is one counter example that I can think of, but it may not be precisely ""free trade/markets"" -- when Ben Franklin first visited England he was asked why the colonies were so prosperous. Ben explained that they used ""Colonial Script"", a kind of barter-dollar, and increasing the supply of script ensured complete employment. The British bankers were furious and immediately lobbied parliament to clamp down on the practice. Within a few years, the colonies were rife with unemployment and poverty just like the rest of the Empire. According to questionable literature handed out by a fringe political party here in Canada, the Founding Fathers had no real complaint about tea taxes, it was the banning of colonial script they were protesting. If this is true, then it comes right back to the forces that killed Ned Ludd's followers as to why popular opinion believes they were protesting a tea tax. The same pamphlet claimed that Canada was also a prosperous nation until, by an act of parliament in the late-50's or early 60's, the right to print money was removed from the juristiction of parliament and handed over to the Bank of Canada. I've wondered about all this.

Maxwell (www.maxwell.com) makes and sells high energy density capacitors, called ultracapacitors. They deliver them in an air-cooled, voltage regulated module that will charge to 42 V and hold 128 kilojoules -- roughly the energy in 2 teaspoons of sugar or a bite of a donut -- and weighs 16 kilograms. If that electrical energy could all be converted to kinetic energy, there's enough to get the capacitor module up to about 200 mph -- in a vacuum. Suppose you take the entire power density of the capacitor module -- 2.8 kw/kg (~4 hp/kg!) -- and punch it through an electric motor. How much does the 64 hp electric motor weigh? If it were as little as 50 kg -- and I bet it isn't -- that capacitor and motor would have a top speed of 100 mph -- the speed at which their energy is the 128 kJ that was initially stored electrically in the capacitor. And it's not at all obvious that the torque vs. speed characteristic of 42 V DC motors will support this, or how they do it without wheels, drive train, etc. But if they can, they can only do it in a vacuum where there is no drag!",0

I think the laws specialing out hate and protected speech are ridiculous. The point I keep trying to make is that there's only two types, speech and action. I agree, they are all speech and should be covered by the First Amendment, but If hate speech is so protected, why are certain states trying to prosecute people for it? There's only two answers and one of them is wrong. 1) Because hate speech is different and needs to have a different level of protection dictated by whoever's offended at the time. 2) It's because it's not just speech, but action. A action who's consequences are foreseeable by any reasonable person. Hate speech is mislabeled. It's really ""threat"". I think they let the mislabeling perpetuate as there's advantage in being able to counter-threat with loss of liberty and money through civil and criminal lawsuits for people THEY don't like.

"""Stephen D. Williams"" <sdw@lig.net>",Slaughter in the Name of God,"An old Indian friend forwarded this to me a while ago. http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&node=&contentId=A58173-2002Mar7&notFound=true Slaughter in the Name of God By Salman Rushdie Friday, March 8, 2002; Page A33 Washington Post The defining image of the week, for me, is of a small child's burned and blackened arm, its tiny fingers curled into a fist, protruding from the remains of a human bonfire in Ahmadabad, Gujarat, in India. The murder of children is something of an Indian specialty. The routine daily killings of unwanted girl babies . . . the massacre of innocents in Nellie, Assam, in the 1980s when village turned against neighboring village . . . the massacre of Sikh children in Delhi during the horrifying reprisal murders that followed Indira Gandhi's assassination: They bear witness to our particular gift, always most dazzlingly in evidence at times of religious unrest, for dousing our children in kerosene and setting them alight, or cutting their throats, or smothering them or just clubbing them to death with a good strong length of wood. I say ""our"" because I write as an Indian man, born and bred, who loves India deeply and knows that what one of us does today, any of us is potentially capable of doing tomorrow. If I take pride in India's strengths, then India's sins must be mine as well. Do I sound angry? Good. Ashamed and disgusted? I certainly hope so. Because, as India undergoes its worst bout of Hindu-Muslim bloodletting in more than a decade, many people have not been sounding anything like angry, ashamed or disgusted enough. Police chiefs have been excusing their men's unwillingness to defend the citizens of India, without regard to religion, by saying that these men have feelings too and are subject to the same sentiments as the nation in general. Meanwhile, India's political masters have been tut-tutting and offering the usual soothing lies about the situation being brought under control. (It has escaped nobody's notice that the ruling party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), or Indian People's Party, and the Hindu extremists of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), or World Hindu Council, are sister organizations and offshoots of the same parent body.) Even some international commentators, such as Britain's Independent newspaper, urge us to ""beware excess pessimism."" The horrible truth about communal slaughter in India is that we're used to it. It happens every so often; then it dies down. That's how life is, folks. Most of the time India is the world's largest secular democracy; and if, once in a while, it lets off a little crazy religious steam, we mustn't let that distort the picture. Of course, there are political explanations. Ever since December 1992, when a VHP mob demolished a 400-year-old Muslim mosque in Ayodhya, which they claim was built on the sacred birthplace of the god Ram, Hindu fanatics have been looking for this fight. The pity of it is that some Muslims were ready to give it to them. Their murderous attack on the train-load of VHP activists at Godhra (with its awful, atavistic echoes of the killings of Hindus and Muslims by the train-load during the partition riots of 1947) played right into the Hindu extremists' hands. The VHP has evidently tired of what it sees as the equivocations and insufficient radicalism of India's BJP government. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee is more moderate than his party; he also heads a coalition government and has been obliged to abandon much of the BJP's more extreme Hindu nationalist rhetoric to hold the coalition together. But it isn't working anymore. In state elections across the country, the BJP is being trounced. This may have been the last straw for the VHP firebrands. Why put up with the government's betrayal of their fascistic agenda when that betrayal doesn't even result in electoral success? The electoral failure of the BJP is thus, in all probability, the spark that lit the fire. The VHP is determined to build a Hindu temple on the site of the demolished Ayodhya mosque -- that's where the Godhra dead were coming from -- and there are, reprehensibly, idiotically, tragically, Muslims in India equally determined to resist them. Vajpayee has insisted that the slow Indian courts must decide the rights and wrongs of the Ayodhya issue. The VHP is no longer prepared to wait. The distinguished Indian writer Mahasveta Devi, in a letter to India's president, K. R. Narayanan, blames the Gujarat government (led by a BJP hard-liner) as well as the central government for doing ""too little too late."" She pins the blame firmly on the ""motivated, well-planned out and provocative actions"" of the Hindu nationalists. But another writer, the Nobel laureate V. S. Naipaul, speaking in India just a week before the violence erupted, denounced India's Muslims en masse and praised the nationalist movement. The murderers of Godhra must indeed be denounced, and Mahasveta Devi in her letter demands ""stern legal action"" against them. But the VHP is determined to destroy that secular democracy in which India takes such public pride and which it does so little to protect; and by supporting them, Naipaul makes himself a fellow traveler of fascism and disgraces the Nobel award. The political discourse matters, and explains a good deal. But there's something beneath it, something we don't want to look in the face: namely, that in India, as elsewhere in our darkening world, religion is the poison in the blood. Where religion intervenes, mere innocence is no excuse. Yet we go on skating around this issue, speaking of religion in the fashionable language of ""respect."" What is there to respect in any of this, or in any of the crimes now being committed almost daily around the world in religion's dreaded name? How well, with what fatal results, religion erects totems, and how willing we are to kill for them! And when we've done it often enough, the deadening of affect that results makes it easier to do it again. So India's problem turns out to be the world's problem. What happened in India has happened in God's name. The problem's name is God.

The MaXLine family features two critical differentiators: huge capacities up to 320 GB for corporate archiving and media recording; and unique manufacturing and quality for 24/7 operations with mean time to failure (MTTF) rates exceeding one million hours. The MaXLine family is designed to bring hard disk drives into ""near-line"" archive applications. By adding a layer of MaXLine drives to archive architectures, companies can instantly recover time-critical data including executive e-mail, transaction data and accounting data that may need to be recovered on demand. These new drives are designed to solve another enterprise problem with the storage of video, media and audio conference call files. Even compressed, these files take up tremendous amounts of high-cost server space. Priced starting around $299.95 to $399.95 MSRP, Maxtor's MaXLine family offers high capacity drives for enterprise applications at price points between traditional ATA and SCSI drives. For system OEMs and white box builders, MaXLine offers high-density, easy-to-integrate storage for use in entry-level and mid-size server environments. ""The demand for instant recall of archived data is expanding as companies are meeting their obligations to quickly access executive e-mails, financial documents and transaction records,"" said Mike Dooley, senior director of marketing for the Desktop Products Group at Maxtor. ""Users may not need to access information in these applications on a daily basis, but when they do need access, it must be instant. Recent advances in ATA technology and our manufacturing processes allow us to build upon our legacy of experience and provide our customers with a family of premium ATA hard drives that can be integrated into a variety of systems for these enterprise applications."" The MaXLine family includes the 5400-RPM MaXLine II, designed for capacities up to 320 GB and the 7200-RPM MaXLine Plus II, designed for capacities up to 250 GB. At these capacities, MaXLine offers higher storage density than many tape and optical solutions. These drives have also been tested and are projected to meet enterprise reliability requirements, already exceeded by prior drives employing the same robust Maxtor designs, which exceed MTTF of over one million hours. These drives will also carry a three-year warranty. The MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus II feature the Maxtor Fast DriveTM UltraATA/133 interface for data transfer speeds up to 133 MB per second. The MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus II will be available with next-generation serial ATA interface for higher performance. At 150 MB per second maximum data transfer rate, serial ATA improves hard drive performance to keep pace with the rapidly increasing performance requirements of data intensive environments and enterprise applications. With a point-to-point connection architecture, and rich command set for managing hard drive activity and data flow along the interface, serial ATA advances the performance and efficiency of the drive to system interface. The interface's reduced pin count allows for simpler cabling which in turn allows better airflow within a system and further benefits the user with increased design flexibility and hot plug capability. ""Maxtor's MaXLine family of drives provide a solution for storing data that has previously been too expensive to keep on disk,"" said Dave Reinsel, analyst at IDC. ""The ATA drives offer a great value, low cost per GB and when integrated into storage systems and file servers offer a compelling cost-effective alternative to tape libraries and optical drives, which have been the traditional solutions used for near-line applications."" Availability Limited qualification units of the parallel ATA versions of Maxtor MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus II are now available; with volume units available in the fourth quarter. Qualification units of the MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus II with serial ATA will be available later this month with volume shipments scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2003.

Niall O Broin <niall@linux.ie>,[ILUG] VPN implementation,"I need to setup a VPN between a few sites. From what I've read, the the choices come down (on the Linux side) to IPsec (using FreeSWAN) or CIPE. It seems that FreeSWAN is 'better', being an implementation of IPsec which is a standard. However, CIPE does the job as well for Linux clients and is somewhat simpler to setup. The problem is that it's not a pure Linux situation - a couple of the sites run OS-X. I'm pretty sure that I'll be able to find an implementation of IPsec for OS-X, but I think CIPE is Linux only. So, the question is for those of you have have implemented BOTH - is there a significant difference in setup time and hassle between CIPE and FreeSWAN ?

Nobody believes advertisements[2] any more. There's a lot of evidence that advertising just doesn't work, no matter how targetted, so if you have a product to sell you have no choice but to get into the editorial side, where consumers' defenses are lowered. Product placements are one example of this. There is an unfortunate tragedy of the commons, here. When advertising first rose to prominence, advertisements _did_ work. We hadn't built up our immunities yet. As more and more advertisers used the opportunity of the medium to lie, we learned not to trust advertisements. But we still trust editorial. And once editorial gets polluted by desperate marketers using PR instead of advertising to promote their message, nobody will believe it either.

There has been a significant recent increase in global CO2 concentrations. The vast preponderance of the new CO2 in the atmosphere is due to human activity starting around the industrialization of Europe, and accelerating after WWII. Most scientists studying global climate change believe that these increased CO2 concentrations are the primary causal agent for increased global warming. Hence our interest in items of human time scale. > It is worth noting that underneath the receding glaciers deposited > during the last major ice age, they are finding substantial evidence of > humans living in what was a nice temperate climate before the glaciers > paved over their civilization.

Most global climate change scientists would agree that temperatures in the past have often been much warmer than today. The point of global warming isn't to save the Earth -- the planet is not sentient. The point is to understand and potentially reduce the impact of increasing temperatures on global human activity. > For anyone to insist that the current negligible fluctuations are > anthropogenic just heaps one ridiculous assertion upon another. I'll > just stick with Occam's Razor for now. The increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration is due to human activity. It is generally accepted that increases in CO2 in a closed environment subject to solar heating retain more of that solar energy. This is the current best explanation for the high temperature of Venus. If the CO2 concentration goes up globally (which it has), then theory states the earth should be retaining greater solar energy. This process may be slow, and may be difficult to monitor due to the variability of temperatures worldwide. I encourage you to refute any part of this causal chain linking CO2 to eventual increases in global energy content, part of which will be evident as heat. - Jim",0

It must be wonderful to be responsible for something you are actually responsible for, and I am so sick of being blamed for other people's design mistakes. Maybe there's an archive somewhere I need to know about, but I've been using C since DrDobbs first published SmallC and yet I've never found any decent LGPL libs cataloged in such a way that I can just type in the task and get back an API. Because of Javadoc, which is by no means perfect, Java provides me the second best catalog of 3rd-party libs, second only to Perl's CPAN -- Perl is one language I also really hate with a passion, yet end up using the most for exactly this reason. For example, take the recent CBC Olympics site: I needed to roll together a telnet client with a tokenizer, perl-regex preprocessing a stream to produce parseable XML, project that XML into relational databases using only the DTD to generate the rdbms schema, and open an XMLRPC interface to read and post items into the news stream.

Can we consider them as > trusted hardware ? SmartCards do not have fixed clock rates (more often than not) as the ISO spec dictates that they are externally powered and clocked, but SmartCards used for security purposes (usually JavaCards) have built-in crypto co-processors that make clock rate irrelevant. 4mhz SmartCards can often preform triple-DES faster than general purpose processors clocked at ten times the speed. That said, clock rate has nothing with how trustworthy a card is. As Michael pointed out, there's something of an arms-race between manufacturers and attackers which has nothing to do with clock rate, and time and time again what we've seen is that it's not a question of ""is it secure"", it's a question of ""who is it secure from and for how long?"" Security is rarely a question of absolutes (despite the often boolean nature of a break), rather it's a question of assessing, quantifying, and managing risk. SmartCards are designed to address threats in which the cost of protection cannot exceed the $1-20 range (depending on the application). As whether or not they are ""trusted hardware"", the question again revolves around attacker and timeframe. One might expect a bored undergrad EE student to have more trouble revealing the contents of a pilfered smartcard than, say, a governtment intelligence service. If your goal is to keep undergrad EEs from perpetrating mass fraud in the caffeteria, then a smartcard is likely ""trustworthy"" enough for your application. If your aim is to protect ICBM launch codes, then it's probably the wrong tool. In either application, a risk/cost ratio must justify the use of the protection measure in question. -- Alex Russell alex@SecurePipe.com alex@netWindows.org",0

Gregory Alan Bolcer <gbolcer@endeavors.com>,Re: Lord of the Ringtones: Arbocks vs. Seelecks,"I got to see Powell talk in March 2001 at the beginning of his reign at the FCC. He said they were going to take a real hands off approach, so it's funny that they would blame the regulators for causing the collapse. One thing he did get right, is that he wasn't worried that the US was behind Europe in the wireless licensing spectrum. This is something very prescient in that most of those licensors have had to eat their lunch over the huge licensing costs they paid for very little benefit. His legacy was/is supposed to be rethinking the FCC's role to stay out of the way in this period of business innovation in the wireless space as he didn't want the government forcing business models onto the private sector. His full transcript is here [1]. Interestingly enough I got to see his speech in person as he was part of the whole CTIA'2001 Las Vegas keynote series of speakers. Clay and I hoped a flight out of Ontario to Las Vegas to do demo support for Craig Barrett [2]. His message was that there's no difference between wired and wireless Internet--it's all the same thing. Instead of scalable networks, we should be thinking about scalable content (& using Magi he showed sending a blue man tv commercial from a desktop to a laptop to an ipaq to a color smartphone with the content scaling back for each target platform). The best part of the whole trip wasn't hobnobbing at all, but really the fact that the Venetian had ran out of rooms. They decided to put us up in one of their $10,000/night high roller rooms. They put Clay in one and me in another. The Venetian is known for having the largest hotel rooms anywhere, but these ones were bigger than my whole house. 8-) Greg [1] http://www.fcc.gov/Speeches/Powell/2001/spmkp101.html [2] http://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/speeches/cb20010320.htm Rohit Khare wrote: > I can't believe I actually read a laugh-out-loud funny profile of the > *FCC Commissioner* fer crissakes!

boingboing <rssfeeds@example.com>,Laura Bush's 419 letter,"URL: http://boingboing.net/#85486499 Date: Not supplied A new addition to the parodical genre of 419 (""Nigerian Money Laundry Scam"") letters from members of the Shrub establishment, following up on Cheney's letter[1]. I am the widow of the late President George W. Bush of the United States of America. I am writing you this letter in confidence regarding my current circumstances. I escaped the United States ahead of death squads with my husband and two children Jenna and Frank, moving first to England and then, when my husband's political enemies took power there, to Austria. All of our wealth, obtained legitimately through baseball, oil drilling and insider trading, was seized by the new government of the USA under the despotic regime of (Dr.) Noam Chomsky, except for the contents of a few Swiss bank accounts. These bank accounts, which contain social security lock-box funds and the bulk of the 2001 budget surplus, could not be accessed by me or my children, due to agreements made between the socialist government of the USA and Swiss bank regulators. They seized our ranch in Crawford, Texas and now use it to teach homosexualist propaganda to schoolchildren.

No, in my opinion, it's purely a bug in SA (or the libraries we use, which is the same thing) that we don't handle outages of network services better. The rule is useful and it does help reduce spam, we should keep it. I have a feeling the DNSBL rules will cluster a bit more heavily around the 1.0 to 2.0 range once we start using the new GA on them. Also, 0.77 was a slightly conservative number. Since I didn't have real-time data, I typically used the lower or median number of different periods (most recent month, two months, six months), depending on the trend of the period data (better performance for recent messages -> favor recent scores, worse performance for recent messages -> favor lowest scores, never pick the highest number unless the rule was very accurate and the highest number was for the most recent data).

"""hyatt@mozilla"" <rssfeeds@example.com>",Usability Problems with Mozilla,"URL: http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/#85409355 Date: Not supplied Blake blogs[1] about how mpt[2] wants Mozilla to look just like MSIE. I have to admit, the evidence is pretty compelling. I recall someone asking me, ""Do you really agree with mpt's Top 10 list? He's quoted you at the top of the list!"" Do I agree that those ten items mpt mentions are the top ten problems? Of course not. No two people will have the same top ten problems. Also keep in mind that mpt and I can agree that something is a problem without necessarily agreeing on the solution to the problem. Maybe we have different ideas regarding how to solve a particular issue, but we at least both believe it is an issue that needs to be addressed. That's something. To cover the list specifically: - Navigator chrome structure - While I don't necessarily agree with mpt's proposed default configuration, I do agree that the chrome structure is painfully restrictive, and that customizable toolbars need to be implemented in order for us to acquire the flexibility to deal with this problem. - Speed - can't argue with this, except to say that cutting out a lot of the useless UI and features from the chrome helps substantially. Reduce bloat, gain speed. - Text editing - if you use Chimera on the Mac, you'll see that the textfield widget is easily the most painful part of the entire application. It's buggy, slow, misbehaves, and doesn't edit the way you'd expect. This is IMO Chimera's top usability problem. - Message display - Yes. No argument here. - Search - Yeah, it's a mess. Don't know if it would be in my top ten, but it's a mess. - Menu structure - This gets back to my blog about how the apps should be separated. The menu structure has been complicated in order to deal with multiple applications. A clean separation naturally simplifies the menus (e.g., you can eliminate the New submenu easily). - Migration - A problem, but IMO not one of the top ten facing Mozilla. - Context menus - mpt complains about two-click context menus, and yet, the OS default on Win32 (overwhelmingly) is to bring up a context menu on a mouse up. If you don't like it, complain about Win32, but don't cite this as a Mozilla usability problem when we're following the conventions of the operating system. (We simply listen for the WM_CONTEXTMENU message. That message fires when Win32 wants to fire it.) - Validation - Err, no. Not a usability problem. To the average bear, this is completely irrelevant. - Preferences - IMO this should be much higher on the list. Preferences are a tangled pathetic mess. Again, separating prefs for individual apps into unique dialogs would simplify things a great deal, but we should also remove nearly half the preferences that exist from the GUI. Mozilla is ridiculously overconfigurable. [1] http://www.blakeross.com/archives/2002_08_18_index.html#80418641 [2] http://mpt.phrasewise.com",0

Tim Chapman <timc@2ubh.com>,[zzzzteana] Worryingly sophisticated bees,"Ananova: Brazilian bees keep their own 'insect ranch' Scientists have found a new species of bee that behaves like a farmer by keeping herds of insects. The Amazonian Schwarzula use their own 'insect ranches' to provide food and building materials. The bees nest in holes in trees alongside 200 aphid-like insects from a species called cryptostigma. Cryptostigma feed on tree sap and excrete a sugar solution, which the bees stop them from drowning in, by licking it up and turning it into honey. The insects also produce wax from glands on their backs, which the bees scrape off and use for their nest. Nature reports it is the first time farming behaviour has been discovered in bees. Biologist Joao Camargo, of the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil, said: ""In turn the bees provide the insects with sanitary benefits and protection."" Writing in the journal Biotropica, Camargo says the bees might even carry their insect ranches around the forest with them and is planning further research on how they tend to their herd. Studies of the Schwarzula showed the bees seemed to get most of their sugar from the insect farms. Some bees were seen licking human sweat for salt.

IMHO. BS> Bill No offense or anything, but there's a difference between holding a sign that doesn't agree with Bush and screaming at him. My sole point, as far as the 1st Amendment goes is that there is more to this game than just being an angry, liberal youth. (Which is the gross culmination of everyone's argument sofar) The screaming isn't the most effective method around. I don't believe I argued that it was. But screaming is happening because the means to communicate to the representatives involved are diminishing, at least as far as the people doing the screaming are concerned. For the record, I don't support the screamers in organized conferences (Such as the Colin Powell shout-down that was mentioned earlier). I don't think that this is what the 1st Amendment was implying. These folks -do- have a right to be heard, and I think they have a right to be heard by the folks they elected in the first place. My point, (my only point) was really more concerned with the cases such as Mr. Nell. He wasn't engaged (at least from the limited facts we have) in a shoutout, but rather in a difference of opinion. He has a right to possess this opinion and make it known to the representatives that are elected. A sign is not a shout-out. I think I may have missed (or not accurately addressed) the original thread switch that took this example and mixed in the screaming dissenters to the mix. I was mostly responding with my miffedness in having broad-brush strokes applied to a group without examining the policy reasons that might have contributed to it. IN this case, the screaming parties are fed up with getting corralled miles away from the folks they need to speak with. They're resorting to creative, offensive and constitutionally challengable means, but its not simply due to the fact that they're 20 and have lost all decorum.

Geege Schuman <geege@barrera.org>,RE: Living Love - Another legacy of the 60's,"draw the pain ""Ken never wrote about this method, but he often demonstrated it in workshops. Let us say you have a physical pain somewhere in your body. You draw the pain in the air with your finger, about 30 cm (1 foot) high. Take about 60 seconds to trace around the perimeter of the pain, carefully listening to the pain to find the precise boundary between where it hurts and where it does not. Repeat. You will find that after about 10 minutes of this the pain will shift, shrink or disappear. A variant of this is to imagine making a 3D model the pain in coloured clay."" Works! There's this coworker - a real pain in my ass! I used my middle finger to trace his outline for about 60 seconds. I listened to him, found the boundary, and repeated the motion.

Williams Sent: Thursday, October 03, 2002 5:33 PM To: fork@example.com Subject: Living Love - Another legacy of the 60's Normally, I disdain any kind of mysticism, even when it is associated with fairly good ideas. Just a big turnoff. A good example would be the difference between Yoga/TM and the more scientifically pure, but related, relaxation techniques including ""betagenics"", hypnosis/auto-hypnosis, etc. (This was one of the many topics I obsessively absorbed as a teenager.) Or Tai Chi etc. vs. Tai Bo / G-Force Dyno-Staff. I have to say however that, having found this while looking for something completely unrelated, it has some cute truisms. I particularly like their addiction to non-addiction. Additionally, the Mindprod treehugger site has some interesting quotes, etc. To my internal ear, nearly all of these 60's based new-age vernacular seem to assume that you are a simple child (of the 60's?) who needs some religion-like couching of ideas to relate and internalize. Very irritating, but taken in small doses it's interesting to compare and contrast with our (my) modern mental models. I found that a few of the principles could be used to explain and justify US/UN foreign policy and actions. http://mindprod.com/methods.html http://members.aol.com/inossence/Kenkey.html http://www.mindprod.com/ (Apologies for the embedded HTML.)

The past is dead, The future is imaginary, Happiness can only be in the Eternal Now Moment How soon will you realize that the only thing you don't have is the direct experience that there's nothing you need that you don't have. Love a person because he or she is there. This is the only reason. Happiness happens when your consciousness is not dominated by addictions and demands~ and you experience life as a parade of preferences.

James Rogers <jamesr@best.com>,Native American economics (was Re: sed /s/United States/Roman Empire/g),"I wanted to get back to this but didn't have the time. I actually lived on a couple different Indian reservations growing up in the Pacific Northwest and also spent a fair amount time in Lakota/Sioux country as well. And my parents have lived on an even more diverse range of Indian reservations than I have (my experience being a direct result of living with my parents). I do get a lot of my information first-hand, or in some cases, second-hand from my father. The income figures for the Indians are somewhat misleading, mostly because it is really hard to do proper accounting of the effective income. While it is true that some Indians live in genuine poverty, it is typically as a consequence of previous poor decisions that were made by the tribe, not something that was impressed upon them. The primary problem with the accounting is that there is a tribal entity that exists separately from the individuals, typically an ""Indian Corporation"" of one type or another where each member of the tribe owns a single share (the details of when and how a share becomes active varies from tribe to tribe). In most tribes, a dividend is paid out to each of the tribal members from the corporation, usually to the tune of $10-30k per person, depending on the tribe. The dividend money comes from a number of places, with the primary sources being the Federal Gov't and various businesses/assets owned by the Indian corporation. You have to understand a couple things: First, a great many Indian tribes are run as purely communist enterprises. Everyone gets a check for their share no matter what. One of the biggest problems this has caused is very high unemployment (often 70-90%) for tribal members, who are more than happy take their dividend and not work. The dividend they receive from the corporation often constitutes their sole ""income"" for government accounting purposes. Unfortunately, to support this type of economics when no one works, they've had to sell off most of their useful assets to maintain those dividends. Many of the tribes genuinely living in poverty do so because they have run out of things to sell yet nobody works. One of the ironies is that on many of the reservations where the tribes still have assets to burn, many of the people working in the stores and such are actually poor white folk, not Indians. Second, even though the tribe members each get a cash dividend, they also receive an enormous range of benefits and perks from the Indian corporation to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars per person annually. By benefits and perks, we are talking about the kinds of things no other ordinary American receives from either their employer or the government. It should be pointed out that while many of these Indian corporations are ineptly run, and mostly provide sinecures for other Indians, a minority are very smartly managed and a few hire non-Indian business executives with good credentials to run their business divisions. An example of this is the Haida Corporation, which while having less 1,000 tribal shareholders, has billions of dollars in assets and the various corporations they own have gross revenues in the $200-300 million range (and growing). Yet the dividend paid out is strictly controlled, about $20k in this particular case, and they engaged in a practice of waiting a couple decades before drawing money from any of the assets they were granted which has led to intelligent investment and use. They don't eat their seed corn, and have actually managed to grow their stash. In contrast, a couple islands over, there is another tribe of ~2,000 people that has a net loss of about $50 million annually IIRC while being regularly endowed by the Federal government with several billions of dollars in valuable assets. This particular tribe has a modest income in theory, but the actual expenditures per person annually is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, and many borrow money against future income. Incidentally, in this particular case, the people that ARE working frequently pull in a few hundred thousand dollars a year, much of which goes back to the tribal corporation rather than their own pockets. Somewhat annoying, the Federal government semi-regularly grants valuable assets to these tribes when they've burned through the ones previously given where feasible, typically selling the assets to American or foreign companies. And the cycle continues. So what is the primary problem for the tribes that have problems? In a nutshell, a thoroughly pathological culture and society. Few women reach the age of 16 without getting pregnant. Incest, rape, and gross promiscuity is rampant. Inbreeding, heavy drug abuse during pregnancy, and other environmental factors have created tribes where a very substantial fraction of the tribe is literally mentally retarded. Many of the thoughtful and intelligent tribe members leave the reservation at the earliest opportunity, mostly to avoid the problems mentioned above. On one reservation my parents lived, the HIV infection rate was >70%. Many of these societies are thoroughly corrupt, and the administration of the law is arbitrary and capricious (they do have their own judges, courts, police etc). In short, many of these tribes that are still hanging together are in a shambles because they have become THE most pathological societies that I have ever seen anywhere. Because of their legal status, there really aren't that many consequences for their behavior. There are many things that I could tell you that I've seen that you probably would not believe unless you'd seen it yourself. There are always good people in these tribes, but it has gotten to the point where the losers and idiots outnumber the good guys by a fair margin many times, and this IS a mobocracy typically. (BTW, if any of you white folk wants to experience overt and aggressive racism as a minority in a place where the rule of law is fiction and the police are openly thugs, try living on one of these messed up Indian reservations. It will give you an interesting perspective on things.) There are only two real situations where you find reasonably prosperous Indians. The first is in the rare case of tribes run by disciplined and intelligent people that have managed their assets wisely. The second is where the tribe has dispersed and assimilated for the most part, even if they maintain their tribal identity. In both of these cases, the tribal leaders reject the insular behavior that tends to lead to the pathological cases mentioned above. The Indians are often quite wealthy technically, and a lot of money is spent by the tribe per capita. And the actual reportable income is quite high when you consider how many are living entirely off the tribal dole. It is just that their peculiar economic structure does not lend itself well to ordinary economic analysis by merely looking at their nominal income.

David Wheeler <dwheeler@ida.org>,Re: Storing passwords,"If you need to store a database password, then clearly the first step is to store the text outside the web tree. You can encrypt it and store the encryption key elsewhere, so that at least an attacker has to get two different things. Also, don't get full privileges - create a user account that is GRANTed very limited access. However, you can often do better than this if security is critical. Create a separate program which has these database keys (as noted above), and make the web program contact IT. Create a very limited protocol that ONLY lets you do the operations you need (you can add specific operations later). There's a performance hit, which you're trading for improved data isolation.

Its relevance is nil. It was a extreme contrived example because you glosded over the point of the earlier 3-person example. But OK, Mr Math, let it be N men and women, for any N>2. They all pair off. Then, some number H, N>H>0, of men has sex with all the other N-1 women he hasn't yet had sex with. Pick any N and H that might be interesting. Any choice of values results in meaningful differences between the sexes' ""promiscuity"", as commonly understood. It should be more obvious with extreme choices of numbers, but it is also true for any choice of N and H, if unrealistic totals distract you. Further, and I was hoping this would be clear without saying so outright, this model actually approximates the cliche ""common wisdom"" about per-gender sexual behavior, if you reverse the male and female roles. Those stereotypes are: that more men than women seek multiple partners -- men being ""more promiscuous"" than women -- and that surplus of male interest is satisfied by a smaller number of hyperpromiscuous women (often derisively labelled ""sluts""). > So I chose not to type ""on average"" explicitly in my post, since this > is FoRK and one tends to assume that people have a clue. > > There is no disagreement between us, except that I am more interested > in typical behaviour and you in extreme. Nope, now you've amended the meaning of your initial statement to make it more defensible. What I objected to was: Robert Harley: # >The assumption that females of all species tend to be less promiscuous # >than males simply does not fit the facts, Hrdy contended. # # Well, DUH!!! # # It is perfectly obvious that (heterosexual) promiscuity is exactly, # precisely identical between males and females. # # Of course the shapes of the distributions may differ. If you assumed people on FoRK had a clue, would you have needed to jump in with a patronizing ""DUH!!""? If you were talking about fuzzy, typical behavior, would you have huffed and puffed with the words ""perfectly obvious"" and ""exactly, precisely identical""? If your concern was with the ""typical"", why didn't you adopt the typical definition of ""promiscuous"", rather than a straw-man definition which allowed you to interject ""DUH!!"" and mock an anthrolopology professor's conclusions? > Actually, you probably just > had a bad day and felt like jumping down my throat for the hell of it. You are welcome to that theory!

It should have been 0. I understand that initially only spammy scores were included. But I believe the algorithm should be purely symmetrical and non-spammy negative values should also have been balancing out the spammy positive values, like they do in SA today.

Daniel Quinlan <quinlan@pathname.com>,Re: [SAdev] fully-public corpus of mail available,"> (Please feel free to forward this message to other possibly-interested > parties.) Some caveats (in decending order of concern): 1. These messages could end up being falsely (or incorrectly) reported to Razor, DCC, Pyzor, etc. Certain RBLs too. I don't think the results for these distributed tests can be trusted in any way, shape, or form when running over a public corpus. 2. These messages could also be submitted (more than once) to projects like SpamAssassin that rely on filtering results submission for GA tuning and development. 3. Spammers could adopt elements of the good messages to throw off filters. And, of course, there's always progression in technology (by both spammers and non-spammers). The second problem could be alleviated somewhat by adding a Nilsimsa signature (or similar) to the mass-check file (the results format used by SpamAssassin) and giving the message files unique names (MD5 or SHA-1 of each file). The third problem doesn't really worry me. These problems (and perhaps others I have not identified) are unique to spam filtering. Compression corpuses and other performance-related corpuses have their own set of problems, of course. In other words, I don't think there's any replacement for having multiple independent corpuses. Finding better ways to distribute testing and collate results seems like a more viable long-term solution (and I'm glad we're working on exactly that for SpamAssassin). If you're going to seriously work on filter development, building a corpus of 10000-50000 messages (half spam/half non-spam) is not really that much work. If you don't get enough spam, creating multi-technique spamtraps (web, usenet, replying to spam) is pretty easy. And who doesn't get thousands of non-spam every week? ;-) Dan",0
Gilles Fabio <gilougero@wanadoo.fr>,hello everybody,"Hi everybody ! My name is Gilles, I'm 19 and I'm french. My english is very bad and I'm sorry if you do not understand correctly my emails. I use Linux since 3 months. Before I worked with Windows 2000 Pro. I enjoy Red Hat... I tried Mandrake, SuSE, Debian, Slackware and my favorite of all of them is Red Hat. Actually I use Red Hat 7.3. I visited the web site Freshrpms, I congratulated Thias for his work. And I subscribed to this list for to know more about Red Hat and RPMs' news. Pleased to read U soon.

boingboing <rssfeeds@example.com>,Dabba Wallahs: India's meal-delivery FedEx,"URL: http://boingboing.net/#85494359 Date: Not supplied Amazing story about the ""dabba wallahs"" -- India's 112-year-old meal-delivery system that outdoes FedEx using pictograms, bicycles, and largely illiterate (but well-compensated) deliverypeople: As part of the tiffin distribution process, every day the meals are picked up from commuters' homes in Mumbai long after the commuters have left for work, delivered to them on time, then picked up and delivered home before the commuters return. Each tiffin carrier has, painted on its top, a number of symbols that identify where the carrier was picked up, the originating and destination stations and the address to which it is to be delivered. After the tiffin carriers are picked up, they are taken to the nearest railway station, where they are sorted according to the destination station. At the destination station they are unloaded by other dabba wallahs and re-sorted, this time according to street address and floor. The 80 kg crates of carriers, carried on dabba wallahs' heads, hand-wagons and cycles are delivered at 12.30 p.m., picked up at 1.30 p.m., and returned when they came. The system relies on multiple relays of dabba wallahs, and a single tiffin box may change hands up to three times during its journey from home to office.

Dermot Daly <dermot.daly@itsmobile.com>,[ILUG] What HOWTOs for SOHO system,"Hi All, I'm trying to set up the following: 1. A Linux server running with a modem for internet connectivity and an ethernet card for LAN connectivity 2. Other LAN pcs with ethernet cards, using the Linux server for DNS/DHCP etc. Basically, I want to route any non LAN traffic through the ppp0. I've got some of the way, but like a similar post earlier about modem problems, when I am connected to the internet with eht0 up, the routing is all incorrect and noting goes out through ppp0 (eh0 must be the default route or something). Is there standard ""out of the box"" Linux tools that will carry out portmapping on behalf of the LAN PCs ? (I'm planning on non routable addresses 192.168.x.x for the LAN, routed outwards via the ppp0 interface). Can someone point me at the right HOWTOs or routing documentation I need to follow ?

Brian Fahrlander <kilroy@kamakiriad.com>,Psyche: Anyone else tried it?,"Damn, this thing is slick. Someone seems to have done a very complete QA test on it; yesterday I installed it for the first time on an old Celeron box. Sure, parts of it were slow, but compared to my more modern machine, everything is. It was good; a beautiful interface that legions of 'sheep' can look at and say ""Cool; I can understand this"" and leave their shackles behind. :) I was struck by the massive amount of applications, both KDE and Gnome, intuitively seperated NOT by the Gnome/KDE names, but by their **meanings** instead. It's obvious that someone spent a lot of time improving the usability and graphics to make it more 'international'; the web browser graphic, for example, has a 'world' icon with a mouse wrapped around it. Office-apps have familiar pens, paper, and/or calculators involved. This is a Linux that I can plop down in front of almost anyone, and they can figure it out. At some point I'd miss the character of KDE/Gnome, and I'll probably 'hotrod' the graphics setup with my own themes, etc. But for the wide release, this one's IT. If you get a chance, try this; I think you'll be surprisingly pleased. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Brian Fahrländer Linux Zealot, Conservative, and Technomad Evansville, IN My Voyage: http://www.CounterMoon.com ICQ 5119262 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Just machines, to make big decisions- programmed by fellas with compassion and vision.

Tom <tomwhore@slack.net>,[vox] Anarchist 'Scavenger Hunt' Raises D.C. Police Ire (fwd),"Anarchist 'Scavenger Hunt' Raises D.C. Police Ire Sat Sep 21, 3:37 PM ET WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An online ""anarchist scavenger hunt"" proposed for next week's annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund ( news - web sites) and World Bank ( news - web sites) here has raised the ire of police, who fear demonstrators could damage property and wreak havoc. Break a McDonald's window, get 300 points. Puncture a Washington D.C. police car tire to win 75 points. Score 400 points for a pie in the face of a corporate executive or World Bank delegate. D.C. Assistant Police Chief Terrance Gainer told a congressional hearing on Friday that law authorities were in talks to decide whether planned protests were, ""so deleterious to security efforts that we ought to take proactive action."" Several thousand people are expected to demonstrate outside the IMF and World Bank headquarters next weekend. The Anti-Capitalist Convergence, a D.C.-based anarchist group, is also planning a day-long traffic blockade, banner-drops and protests against major corporations in the downtown core. Chuck, the 37 year-old webmaster of the anarchist site www.infoshop.org who declined to give his last name, told Reuters his scavenger hunt was meant as a joke. ""People were asking for things to do when they come to D.C. We made the list to get people thinking, so they don't do the boring, standard stuff,"" he said. ""I doubt people will actually keep track of what they do for points.""",0
